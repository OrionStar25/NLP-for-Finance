      "Originally posted by kervio I think the update said median age of the first set of patients was around mid 50s and median age of the later set of patients was around 69 so they would have only had to have put the inclusion criteria in half way through the trial when the evidence was emerging that age was a huge factor in deaths in order to have a successful trial This is the big what if that might have sent the SP to 10 FDA approval lives saved etc We can give them a pass on not knowing that up front for sure because of the speed in which the trial moved forwards on but I think some reactivity would have saved the day here once more was known about covid in the same way that we found out about comorbidities leading to higher rates of death I disagree with this This disease has been totally wacky in respect of different age cohorts and no one has or has had any idea what is going to happen to any given age group once confronted with the disease or results impact COVID has everyone flummoxed until the Brazil variant turned everything on its head which happened after the trial there was lots of clear evidence in white papers about the effect of age on covid mortality The inclusion criteria is there to stop random chance from derailing your study so if they had say 10 or so 80yo patients that were enrolled and bound to die no matter what it lessons the effect of your treatment on a saveable demographic within your cohort I agree with your excitement on what the results though and I think this therapy has some big potential to show effect and get approval in a confirmatory trial with appropriate design It s better than I expected the results to be Expand Hey Good points on age effect I guess I was thinking more broadly say in respect of MIS C in kids under 50s getting blood clots with the Astra Zeneca and J J vaccines etc A lot about COVID has been very unpredictable As well we don t know what conversations if any were had between MSB NIH the FDA and the DSMB Clearly someone made the decision not to modify the inclusion criteria and continue the trial opting to halt it instead Most likely NOT MSB s choice and I doubt they would have been given enough information by the DSMB to allow them to make this call on their own I am clearly not qualified to speak on the issue of course LeftYahoo had a good point about the silver lining here though we get the full trial results that much earlier with it having been halted Fingers crossed the NIH the FDA and Novartis are as excited about these amazing results as we are\n",

      "What s your role in AngloGold Ashanti Sam Jonah questioned After his public address to Rotary Club in Accra Sam Kwesi Esson Jonah KBE has come under immense criticism from persons close to the government who feel that portions of his address attacked the Executive The latest criticism is coming from Paul Adom Otchere host of Good Evening Ghana GEG who in his biweekly show on Metro TV tried to punch holes in the senior stateman s speech According to him Sam Jonah KBE must have had a role in Ashanti Gold which later turned into AngloGold Ashanti therefore he should be able to tell the young people of Ghana the role he played while working with the company On his show Thursday April 29 2021 Adom Otchere stated that if Sam Jonah KBE wants to talk about the future of Ghana then he must first of all open up about his past Sam Jonah cannot come and talk about the future without answering questions about his past it behoves him to make statements about his past If he won t say anything at all at least we know his role with Adisadel College and AshGold Football Club we do not know his role in that major transaction that has punctuated the corporate and political history of our society the Ashanti transaction Paul Adom Otchere said on his show monitored by GhanaWeb He indicated that there are two Ashanti transactions one was failed by the government of Ghana which left a lot of rancour s between JJ Rawlings and Sam Jonah and their relationship broke off completely We don t know the details Sam Jonah must come and tell us And then the transaction was rehashed and relaunched in 2001 and 2002 this time it was supported by the JA Kufuor government and it was successful In both transactions there was a critical decision about the heritage of the Ghanaian young person because this gold resource which is a Ghanaian resource was being treated in a certain way was it being treated in the right way to guarantee the future of the young people that today Sam Jonah is concerned about Was it being treated in a certain way that eventually guaranteed our future Was there an option with Randgold resources and other people who wanted to participate that could have been better for the future of Ghana he asked Adom Otchere stressed that Sam Jonah KBE must answer these questions He Sam Jonah is a big man he has been around for a very long time and he comes and says the youth of Ghana I now feel the responsibility to speak and you don t tell us what you ve been doing in the past when you have had such a tenacious relationship with the political decision making of Ghana since 1983 you won t tell us what has happened about that Paul Adom Otchere argues that Sam Jonah s answer to the question will help the Ghanaian youth understand whether or not he has found a new philosophy or a new idea So that we can understand whether the idea you present today is the idea that has been with you for a very long time If that idea that you present today is not an idea that has been with for a long time it is still a welcome idea but we want to know so that we put it on record because the record is important he stressed\n",

Japan For the fiscal year under review demand remained steady centering on public works on which the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic had a small impact Nevertheless sales declined from the previous fiscal year as adversely affected by slack private sector construction as well as limited sales and service activities in the first six month period Americas In North America sales dropped from the previous fiscal year While demand for construction equipment was on a recovery track in the housing sector and the rental industry it was adversely affected by sluggish economic conditions under the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic and that for construction and mining equipment remained slack in the energy related sector In Latin America demand for construction equipment remained steady in Brazil and sales of mining equipment increased to Chilean copper mines However sales declined from the previous fiscal year as mainly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic especially in the first six month period Europe and CIS In Europe sales decreased from the previous fiscal year as demand remained sluggish in the first six month period although demand was on a recovery track from the adverse effects of the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic in the major markets of Germany the United Kingdom and France as well as in Italy In CIS sales declined affected by sluggish demand for mining equipment in coal mines and depreciation of the Russian ruble while demand was steady in gold mines and that for construction equipment was on a recovery track in infrastructure development and energy related sectors China While the share of sales made by domestic manufacturers increased demand remained steady supported by the government s economic stimulus measures such as infrastructure investment after containing the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic Furthermore demand advanced in the fiscal year under review driven by the post Chinese New Year sales season in February and because the previous year s sales season in February was pushed back by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic As a result sales increased from the previous fiscal year Asia and Oceania In Asia demand showed steady recovery centering on construction equipment in Indonesia Thailand and Malaysia and some signs of recovery for mining equipment emerged in coal mines in Indonesia in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of recovering coal prices However sales dropped sharply from the previous fiscal year as particularly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic in the first six month period In Oceania sales increased supported by steady demand for mining equipment in iron ore mines as well as for construction equipment Middle East and Africa In the Middle East sales improved from the previous fiscal year supported by steady demand especially in Turkey while demand remained slack in Saudi Arabia largely affected by sluggish crude oil prices and the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic In Africa demand for construction equipment remained slack in Southern Africa mainly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic While some signs of recovery of demand surfaced in other regions sales declined as affected by reduced sales of mining equipment as well Retail Finance While assets increased reflecting an increase in new contracts centering on North America as well as the affects of foreign exchange rates in the fourth quarter revenues decreased by 6 4 from the previous fiscal year to JPY 66 3 billion as affected by a drop in new contracts in the nine month period Segment profit fell by 16 6 to JPY 10 5 billion mainly reflecting the adverse effects of an extension of payments and revaluation of vehicles after lease use Industrial Machinery and Others For the fiscal year under review sales fell by 3 6 from the previous fiscal year to JPY 171 2 billion This was mainly affected by slack capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses sheet metal machines and machine tools as well as their delayed installation at customers overseas workplaces especially under the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic Meanwhile segment profit increased by 19 3 to JPY 16 3 billion as sales remained steady for Excimer laser related business in the semiconductor market Projections for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31 2022 From April 1 2021 to March 31 2022 In the construction mining and utility equipment business Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase as it believes that demand will continue to recover from the fiscal year under review returning to the level prior to the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic By region Komatsu anticipates demand will expand especially in Asia North America and Latin America In China Komatsu expects that demand will decline from the fiscal year under review when the post Chinese New Year sales season occurred twice Nevertheless Komatsu projects that global demand will increase from the fiscal year under review Furthermore Komatsu projects that demand for mining equipment will remain steady in iron ore copper and gold mines while it will enter a recovery track in coal mines With respect to profits Komatsu expects that they will advance reflecting an increase in volume of sales differences in composition of sales and improved selling prices In the retail finance business Komatsu anticipates both sales and segment profit will improve mainly due to an increase in new contracts In the industrial machinery and others business Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase as sales of machine tools and the Excimer laser related business should grow respectively in the automobile manufacturing industry and on the semiconductor market As preconditions for its projection Komatsu is assuming the foreign exchange rates

previous fiscal year end to 50 5 For the fiscal year under review net cash provided by operating activities totaled JPY 354 1 billion an increase of JPY 58 9 billion from the previous fiscal year largely reflecting decreased inventories Net cash used in investing activities amounted to JPY 163 0 billion a decrease of JPY 27 8 billion from the previous fiscal year due mainly to the purchase of fixed assets Net cash used in financing activities amounted to JPY 199 6 billion as compared to JPY 3 4 billion used for the previous fiscal year mainly due to the repayment of debt and payment of

DECREASE OF THE NET INCOME DUE TO DISAPPOINTING OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL AND INDIA NON AUDITED KEY CONSOLIDATED FIGURES 20 20 201 9 Var Revenues EUR m 2 5 2 8 12 EBITDA EUR m 2 0 1 4 4 5 Net Income EUR m 2 1 3 6 4 1 Shareholders Equity EUR m 1 16 1 21 4 Cash and Financial assets 10 5 103 1 closed 2020 with a net result Group share of EUR 2 1m compared to EUR 3 6m in 2019 This decline essentially stems from on one hand a drop of the Brazilian operational result due to a very low generation coupled with a massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency and on the other hand an increase of the impairment of the Indian projects leading to an overall decline of the result The EBITDA is also down by 45 EUR 2 0m in 2020 vs EUR 1 4 m in 2019 Net financial gains which amounted to EUR 7 7m were almost stable compared to EUR 8 1m in 2019 mostly because of the reallocation of the portfolio from corporate bonds to equity and commodities Shareholder s equity decreased by 4 mainly due to the share buyback programs executed in 2020 492 k shares bought back in 2020 for a total price of EUR 3 1m During 2020 the continued developing its hydropower concessions located in India 571 MW and operated its Rodeio Bonito hydropower plant 15 MW in Brazil The uncertainties and deadlocks of the Indian hydropower market remained as in 2019 and prevented progress of the projects leading to an additional provision or Eur 2 8 million 20 for FY 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 considering the previously booked provisions This additional provision was already accounted for in the 2020 half yearly results published in October 2020 The Rodeio Bonito plant generation was historically low 40 below the 2019 generation as a result of the severe draught in the south of Brazil which led to an increase of the payments to the MRE system 1 At constant foreign exchange rates the turnover has grown 18 thanks to the inflation of selling prices In Euro the turnover is down by 12 EUR 2 5 m in 2020 vs EUR 2 8 m in 2019 because of the massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency in 2020 41 FINANCIAL YEAR 20 20 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE BUSINESS India The hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the State of Arunachal Pradesh could not make significant progress due to several long lasting administrative and regulatory impediments aggravated by the Covid 19 pandemic The Techno Economic Clearance TEC Environmental Clearance Forest Clearance as well as most of the post TEC investigations being complete for the tandem Heo Tato 1 426 MW the main next development steps for these 2 projects are the land acquisition the transport infrastructure the amendment of the concession agreements the stage 2 Forest Clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable Power Purchase Agreement PPA These steps however essentially fall under the purview and responsibility of the State and Central Governments During 2020 the land acquisition procedure conducted by the State Government was halted due to a stoppage of the land survey by several land owners who physically prevented the District administration to enter some parts of the land complaining about land ownership disputes and claiming immediate financial compensations The discussions initiated between the state government and the concerned owners in February 2020 were suspended due to the Covid 19 outbreak as the required meetings could happen only physically The procedure could restart only in February 2021 All the on site surveys and boundary markings were completed by the in March 2021 without interruption As of the date of this press release the Group has not received the official survey report and list of land owners from the However the Group s team attended each survey and it is the Group understanding that significant parts of the land requirement have again been registered by the as being under ownership dispute and that the survey may lead to an increase of disputed areas as compared to earlier lists established by the State Government The Group does not know yet if and how the Government of Arunachal Pradesh GoAP will settle these disputes and find a solution that will allow permanent site access and the Projects implementation considers that as per the current concession agreement and applicable regulations the land acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the exclusive responsibility of the licensing Government The concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer Negotiations with the GoAP for the amendment of the concession agreement relate to the development timeframe but also to the amendment of the allocated capacities still 380MW in the current concession agreement and other important terms have not progressed since 2018 This has led to the impossibility to renew the TECs of the Heo and Tato 1 426 MW tandem in 2020 as such renewal required either a concession agreement up to date with the 426 MW capacity approved by CEA or a non objection certificate NOC from the GoAP TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP granted in 2015 for 3 years and already extended a first time in 2018 for 2 years were bearing validities until on 27 th July 2020 and 28 th October 2020 respectively Applications for renewals of both TECs were submitted to CEA which requested the Group to obtain from GoAP a NOC acknowledging that the GoAP has no objection to the renewal of the projects TECs for the current capacities of 240 MW and 186 MW After several discussions the GoAP refused on 1 st October 2020 to issue a NOC unless the concession agreements were amended under conditions entailing significant financial costs some of which the Group does not agree with After requesting a draft amendment to the GoAP during Q4 2020 without success the Group finally sent its own proposed draft amendment in Q1 2021 Its main provisions relate to the allocated installed capacities the administrative fees the development timeframe the obligations of both parties and the increase of the free power to the GoAP against the withdrawal of its potential equity participation in the projects The provisions have been proposed by the Group considering the historical difficulties and the ground reality of the projects and of the Indian hydropower market As of the date of this press release the discussions are going on with the GoAP but both TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP are technically not valid anymore and their renewal is depending on the execution of the revised concession agreement in addition to the CEA renewal procedure The road infrastructures have kept progressing at a slow pace during 2020 as they did in previous years No progress has been made by the regarding the acceleration of the overall completion schedule The scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade up to the projects site are still scheduled theoretically in 2022 but will most likely face significant delays of 2 to 3 years given that for some stretches the technical studies have not yet even been completed On the forest clearance side the renewal of the stage I clearance has been applied for in September 2020 and is still under progress as of date The Group continued to explore the Indian market and to conduct its preliminary search for a PPA during 2020 All the major Indian power traders PPA brokers and distribution companies DISCOMS contacted for Heo and Tato 1 either declined to take up a commercial discussion for a PPA or did not respond The continued lack of appetite of the market for hydropower PPAs results from the commercial and financial Indian market conditions which remained the same during 2020 and still do not fulfil the requirements for the long term and bankable sale of hydropower The market remained constrained by the lack of appropriate regulatory framework for such bankable PPAs the stressed financial position of electricity distribution companies DISCOMS and the indirect competition of cheap solar and wind power Grid stability and the requirement for peak power 2 have also become a growing issue for Run of the River ROR hence with no storage hydro projects such as Heo and Tato 1 HEPs Two years after the announcement of the new hydropower policy by the a first part of the long awaited implementation regulation has finally be issued imposing a Hydropower Purchase Obligation HPO on DISCOMS setting a percentage of power that shall be procured by them from hydropower sources between 2021 and 2030 These percentages range from 0 18 to 2 82 and are remarkably lower than those of solar power currently at 10 25 for 2021 The question is raised within the industry whether these provisions will be sufficient to trigger a general revival of the hydropower sector and enough demand for long term bankable PPAs for projects which are not yet under construction Despite the above issues the Group s projects are the only hydropower projects of such size in India owned and developed by a foreign investor They are amongst the most advanced private projects and present competitive techno economic and environmental features Despite long term promising prospects the current Indian power market and especially the hydropower sector are still characterized by a lot of uncertainties The Groups projects have been heavily delayed several years in a row These delays and uncertainties have been reflected in an additional provision of Eur 2 8 million 20 of gross value decided for first semester 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 of gross value considering the cumulated provisions booked in previous years EUR 4 4m or 30 of gross value The Indian projects activities have been detailed in chapter I 4 1 of the annual report available at Brazil The Rodeio Bonito Hydropower plant 15 MW recorded a historically low production of 29 496 MWh in 2020 40 below the 2019 generation 49 113 MWh in 2019 and close to its all time record low of 2012 24 793 MWh However the turnover when expressed in the Brazilian currency BRL was up thanks to the inflation and the MRE system But as a result of this very low electricity generation and the national low hydro generation in 2020 the plant had to compensate the MRE system which was in a negative position This is why payments to the MRE were much higher reaching EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 As a result the EBITDA of the plant amounted to BRL 8 1m against BRL 9 3m in 2019 down by 13 When converted in euro the EBITDA of the plant was significantly lower to EUR 1 4m vs 2 1m in 2019 51 mostly due to a 34 depreciation of the average rate of the Brazilian Real vs Euro currency in 2020 Financial Assets also continued to manage actively its treasury throughout a complicated year marked by the Covid 19 pandemic and its impact on the financial markets The Group executed an important reallocation of its investments in other asset classes The Group started the year with a portfolio invested at approximately 60 in bonds mostly high yield corporate ones This bond portfolio was reduced by approximately half in January and February as the rewards seemed not any more commensurate with the potential default risks Since the March 2020 market crunch the Group has gradually changed its asset allocation to include more exposure to equity and commodities mostly gold As of 31 st December 2020 the bonds exposure including T bills was reduced to 19 of the portfolio 64 as of 31 12 19 whereas the rest of the portfolio of cash financial assets and financial liabilities EUR 104 5 m included a negative net cash position of EUR 9 3 m 9 of the portfolio versus a positive net debt position of EUR 27 2 m in 2019 25 of the portfolio 19 of gold related exposure versus 1 as of 31 12 2019 21 of oil related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 4 of silver related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 42 of equity excluding oil long positions 7 as of 31 12 2019 4 of equity short positions 2 in 2019 1 in private equity and credit 3 in 2019 While reallocating its financial assets towards equity the Group has invested in companies which were trading at historically low prices and could benefit from the improvement of the Covid 19 situation The two sectors hence selected were banking and energy This strategy of reallocation of the financial assets proved profitable as the Group net financial assets rose from Eur 103 million to Eur 105 million and the financial result amounted to EUR 7 7 m as of 31 12 2020 stable when compared to 2019 EUR 8 1 m and despite the COVID 19 crisis Given the current very low levels of benchmark rates in all developed markets USA Europe and Japan the Group does not anticipate it will increase again its investments in corporate bonds in the medium term The Group has reduced significantly its financial exposure to the USD and increased its exposure to the Euro and the Japanese Yen As of 31 12 2020 the Group financial assets were exposed notably to the US Dollars 35 against 67 in 2019 the Japanese Yen 25 against 2 in 2019 and the Euro 22 against 9 in 2019 It is to be noted that the Gold and Silver positions are priced in USD and as such are included in the former USD exposure Contrary to the previous years the Group has fully invested its cash and has used some leverage see above net cash position The financial portfolio is detailed in part I section 3 1 B of the annual report 2020 available at During the year continued to execute buyback programs in order to provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to sell their shares The shares are bought back in view of their cancellation or to cover for new grants of free shares A total of 492 348 shares were bought back in 2020 for a total price of Eur 3 131 696 275 000 shares were cancelled in April 2020 and as of 31 st December 2020 held 314 023 own shares representing 5 66 of its share capital Foreseeable evolution of the Group After the closing of this financial year the Group is pursuing the following main objectives as a priority for FY 2021 Pursuing the development of the Indian hydropower projects On the short term executing the required amendment to the concession agreements of the Indian hydropower projects in order to secure the renewal of the TECs and the renewal of Forest clearances Continue the active management of its diversified financial investments The ability of the Group to pursue these objectives is subject to the evolution of the current Covid 19 crisis which may affect both the development of the Indian projects and the financial portfolio FINANCIAL YEAR 2020 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Statement unaudited consolidated Turnover amounted to EUR 2 5m against EUR 2 8m in 2018 a 12 decrease mainly from electricity sales in Brazil The turnover in local currency increased by 18 with the inflation on electricity sale prices However the depreciation of the Brazilian currency vs the Euro currency was responsible for a 34 decrease of the turnover in Euro The current operating result amounted to EUR 5 6m against 4 3m in 2019 Payments to the MRE Energy Reallocation Mechanism were EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 Depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets of Rodeio Bonito plant amounted to EUR 0 5m EUR 0 7m in 2019 while depreciation on

Group employed on average 20 permanent employees in 2020 External expenses are totaling EUR 1 4m in 2020 vs EUR 1 5m in 2019 Net Financial Gain for the group amounted to EUR 7 7m in 2020 mostly because of the reallocation strategy from bonds to equity and commodities markets and despite the USD depreciation 9 compared to end of 2019 and its impact on the Group s cash and financial assets position The impact of this depreciation has been managed by the currency reallocation strategy of the Group avoiding bigger potential forex losses see breakdown per currency in chapter I 7 4 of the annual report This gain of 7 7m compares to EUR 8 1m in 2019 In 2020 other operating income EUR 0 2m consisted mainly of earn out gains on Brazilian assets related to Brazilian assets divested in previous years This figure was NIL in 2019 Income tax expense amounted to EUR 0 2m in 2020 same as in 2019 The net result Group share was EUR 2 1m in 2020 FY compared to EUR 3 6m in 2019 The Group s EBITDA reached EUR 2 0m compared to EUR 1 4m in 2019 The strong depreciation of BRL 41 and INR Indian Currency 12 closing rates when compared to Euro at 2020 closing date has heavily and negatively impacted the other comprehensive income as the Group s main tangible and intangible investments have been done in local currency EUR 4 5m in 2020 against EUR 0 1m in 2019 The total comprehensive income amounts to a loss of EUR 2 4m in 2020 against a gain of EUR 3 5m in 2019 Balance sheet Assets unaudited consolidated Net intangible assets stands at 8 3m in 2020 and are down by EUR 3 7m versus

costs on Indian projects Net tangible assets stands at 5 3m in 2020 and decreased by EUR 2 7m between 2019 and 2020 mainly because of depreciation of the Rodeio Bonito plant EUR 0 5m and the depreciation of the Brazilian currency EUR 2 3m Cash cash equivalent assets and financial assets net of Current financial liabilities have increased from EUR 103m in 2019 to EUR 105m in 2020 1 mainly thanks the good performance of the Group s financial portfolio and despite the share buyback programs Financial assets consist mainly in listed equity bonds and commodities related stocks Finally total assets increased by 15 3 during 2020 FY up by EUR 18 9 m mostly because of the bank overdraft facility described in below as part of the liabilities and the related asset purchases At 31 st December 2020 the Group and its subsidiaries holds 314 023 own shares 2019 146 810 At year end closing price of EUR 6 41 those own shares have a market value of EUR 2 0m Balance sheet Liabilities

accumulated interests and judicial expenses Trade and other payables amount to EUR 0 9 m vs EUR 0 5m in 2019 due to EUR 0 3 m of payable related to MRE payments in Brazil due in early 2021 but related to 2020 generation Current financial liabilities of EUR 23 9 m in 2020 vs NIL in 2019 are related to overdraft facilities granted by a brokerage firm to the Group to leverage its listed investments trading activities Under this facility securities held in the trading account are used as a security to borrow money This facility has enabled the Group to leverage its investments and maximize its profits But it is to be noted that leverage works both ways and could also cause higher losses in case of fall in market prices Own shares booked directly against the equity of the Group at their historical cost reduce the net shareholder s equity of the Group by EUR 2 1m at 31 st December 2020 versus EUR 1 2m at 31 st December 2019 following the share buyback programs EUR 3 1m the capital

the reputational blight All the while ransomware gangsters have become more brazen and cocky as they put more and more lives and livelihoods at risk This week one syndicate threatened to make available to local criminal gangs data they say they stole from the Washington D C metro police on informants Another recently offered to share data purloined from corporate victims with Wall Street inside traders Cybercriminals have even reached out directly to people whose personal info was harvested from third parties to pressure victims to pay up In general the ransomware actors have gotten more bold and more ruthless said Allan Liska an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future On April 29 a public private task force including Microsoft Amazon the National Governors Association the FBI Secret Service and Britain and Canada s elite crime agencies delivered to the White House an 81 page urgent action plan for an aggressive and comprehensive whole of government assault on ransomware At the report s online launch Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a pre recorded video that the White House is developing a plan for disrupting ransomware and his department will work to implement many of the panel s recommendations because one thing is clear Ransomware is a threat to our national security Mayorkas last month announced a DHS ransomware initiative and the Department of Justice has just created a task force to tackle the scourge Where did ransomware come from How does it work The criminal syndicates that dominate the ransomware business are mostly Russian speaking and operate with near impunity out of Russia and allied countries They are a continuation and refinement ransomware was barely a blip three years ago of more than two decades of cyber thieving that spammed stole credit cards and identities and emptied bank accounts The syndicates have grown in sophistication and skill leveraging dark web forums to organise and recruit while hiding their identities and movements with tools like the Tor browser and cryptocurrencies that make payments and their laundering harder to track Ransomware scrambles a victim organisation s data with encryption The criminals leave instructions on infected computers for how to negotiate ransom payments and once paid provide software decryption keys Last year ransomware crooks expanded into data theft blackmail Before triggering encryption they quietly exfiltrate sensitive files and threaten to expose them publicly unless ransoms are paid Victims who diligently backed up their networks as a hedge against ransomware now had to think twice about refusing to pay At the end of 2019 only one ransomware group had an extortion site online that would publish such files Now more than two dozen do Victims who refuse to pay can incur costs that far exceed the ransoms they might have negotiated It happened recently to the University of Vermont Health Network It suffered an estimated US 1 5mil a day in losses in the two months it took to recover More than 5 000 hospital computers their data scrambled into gibberish had to be wiped clean and reconstituted from backed up data The University of California San Francisco heavily involved in Covid 19 research barely hesitated before paying It gave the criminals US 1 1mil last June Manufacturers have been especially hard hit this year with ransoms of US 50mil demanded of computer makers Acer and Quanta a major supplier of Apple laptops How are these criminals organised Some top ransomware criminals fancy themselves software service professionals They take pride in their customer service providing help desks that assist paying victims in file decryption And they tend to keep their word They have brands to protect after all If they stick to their promises future victims will be encouraged to pay up Maurits Lucas director of intelligence solutions at the cybersecurity firm Intel471 told a webinar earlier this year As a victim you actually know their reputation The business tends to be compartmentalised An affiliate will identify map out and infect targets choose victims and deploy ransomware that is typically rented from a ransomware as a service provider The provider gets a cut of the payout the affiliate normally taking more than three quarters Other subcontractors may also get a slice That can include the authors of the malware used to break into victim networks and the people running the so called bulletproof domains behind which the ransomware gangs hide their command and control servers Those servers manage the remote sowing of malware and data extraction ahead of activation a stealthy process that can take weeks Why do ransoms keep climbing How can they be stopped In Thursday s report the task force says it would be wrong to try to ban ransom payments largely because ransomware attackers continue to find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack The task force recognises that paying up can be the only way for an afflicted business to avoid bankruptcy Worse the sophisticated cybercriminals often have done their research and know a victim s cybersecurity insurance coverage limit They ve been known to mention it in negotiations That degree of criminal savvy helped drive average ransom payments to more than US 310 000 last year up 171 from 2019 according to Palo Alto Networks a task force member Not surprisingly the still young cyber insurance industry is reeling Premiums have gone up by 50 to 100 in the past year as ransomware became the No 1 claim said Michael Phillips chief claims officer of Resilience Insurance and a co chair of the task force On average cyber insurance claim payouts can now exceed 70 of what is paid in premiums prompting some insurers to drop this type of insurance altogether industry reports show The multi pronged response to ransomware proposed by the task force will require the kind of concerted diplomatic legal and law enforcement cooperation with key allies that the Trump administration shunned displacing what the authors call the current uncoordinated disjointed response There is no silver bullet but if we re going to shift the trajectory of this type of attack the US government has got to get at this with some speed said task force co chair Philip Reiner CEO of the nonprofit Institute for Security and Technology Ransomware developers and their affiliates should be named and shamed they are not always easy to identify and regimes that enable them punished with sanctions the report urges It calls for mandatory disclosure of ransom payments and a federal response fund to provide financial assistance to victims in hopes that in many cases it will prevent them from paying ransoms And it wants stricter regulation of cryptocurrency markets to make it more difficult for criminals to launder ransomware proceeds The task force also calls for something potentially controversial amending the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to let private industry actively block or limit online criminal activity including of botnets the networks of hijacked zombie computers that ransomware criminals use to sow infections The odds of successfully stifling ransomware are high the report s authors acknowledge The old adage that a cybercriminal only has to be lucky once while a defender has to be lucky every minute of every day has never been more true AP\n",

Trident Royalties Plc Trident or the Company Q1 2021 Activities Update Transformational Lithium Royalty Acquisition Fundraising Continued Strength in Commodities Trident Royalties Plc AIM TRR FSX 5KV is pleased to provide an update on its activities undertaken during the first quarter ended 31 March 2021 including Q1 royalty receipts HIGHLIGHTS Q1 saw a significant increase in battery metals exposure in conjunction with an oversubscribed equity financing Trident completed its most significant transaction to date with the acquisition of a 60 interest in a gross revenue royalty GRR over the Thacker Pass Project Thacker Pass for a total consideration of US 28 0 million comprising US 26 0 million in cash and US 2 0 million in new ordinary shares in Trident Thacker Pass contains the largest defined lithium Mineral Reserve in the United States A successful concurrent equity financing of approximately GBP20 7 million approximately US 28 8 million was conducted at no discount to the prevailing market price to execute the Thacker Pass lithium royalty transaction and strengthen the balance sheet Trident completed the Talga gold royalties transaction and shortly post quarter end completed the previously announced Pukaqaqa copper royalties transaction finalising the acquisition of these seven royalties and With a portfolio inclusive of copper iron ore gold and now lithium Trident is increasingly reflective of the broader global mining sector providing investors with an inflation hedge in the face of loose global monetary policy and direct exposure to a once in a generation energy revolution Q1 royalty payments totalling approximately US 451 314 from royalties over producing assets an increase of 55 over Q4 2020 Royalty Stream Q1 2021 Payment Cumulative Payments since Acquisition Koolyanobbing iron A 100 479 A 2 740 884 ore royalty 1 Mimbula copper royalty US 375 000 US 453 707 Mimbula copper royalty payment of US 375 000 based on the Minimum Payment Schedule MPS under the royalty agreement representing a significant increase over Q4 2020 Q1 2021 production saw 671 tonnes of copper sold an increase over Q4 2020 as the project continues to ramp up The MPS on the Mimbula copper royalty continues in 2021 US 375 000 per quarter in 2021 less any excess payments made above the MPS from previous quarters increasing to US 500 000 per quarter in 2022 and US 750 000 for the first two quarters of 2023 2 Koolyanobbing iron ore royalty payment of A 100 479 US 76 314 3 a decrease over Q4 2020 on higher received price but lower volumes from the royalty area Trident notes the average grade at Koolyanobbing has fallen from 59 to 57 Fe since 2H20 Recent unprecedented strength in the iron ore market particularly for low grade fines products may incentivise operators to opportunistically favour production from lower grade areas in the short term 4 Trident s royalty covers a substantial portion of the Deception pit the highest grade deposit and a significant proportion of the total Koolyanobbing reserves Trident anticipates deferred production of this higher quality ore will benefit the Company in the short medium term Trident also notes the recent strategy overview presentation by Mineral Resources Limited the project operator which highlighted the impending finalisation of a 10 year plan for the Yilgarn Hub of which Koolyanobbing and its associated infrastructure is the central component Additionally Mineral Resources flagged the expansion of the Yilgarn Hub to 12Mtpa as a further growth opportunity and Commodity prices underlying Trident s royalty portfolio remained strong throughout Q1 2021 with iron ore averaging US 131 tonne copper averaging 8 503 tonne lithium carbonate equivalent LCE averaging US 9 083 tonne and gold averaging US 1 793 oz 5 Post quarter end copper has continued to climb to near 10 year highs while LCE prices have now doubled year to date to over US 13 500 tonne Q1 royalty portfolio growth combined with positive asset level progress by project operators Thacker Pass Lithium Project 6 In January 2021 Lithium Americas Corp LAC the project operator announced the receipt of the final key federal permit for the project followed shortly thereafter by a US 400 million equity fundraise primarily to fund the commencement of construction With the acquisition of 60 of the GRR Trident now has exposure to a key global lithium asset with a clear pathway to production Other highlights include Thacker Pass currently contains a CIM compliant Mineral Reserve of 3 1Mt LCE the largest lithium reserve in the United States with an anticipated mine life of 46 years based on reserves Thacker Pass is at an advanced stage of development with a highly attractive Pre Feasibility Study PFS announced on 21 June 2018 and a Definitive Feasibility Study due for completion in 2021 LAC has announced that key permits are in place with commencement of construction targeted for late 2021 or early 2022 and Trident expects Phase 1 production to start ramping up in 2024 The GRR is subject to a partial operator buy back which Trident expects will be exercised by LAC for proceeds to Trident of US 13 2 million during the first year of operation the Buyback Based on the PFS parameters published by LAC including an LCE price of 12 000 tonne Phase 1 steady state royalty revenue attributable to Trident is anticipated to be approximately US 3 8 million per annum increasing to US 7 6 million per annum at Phase 2 steady state assuming the Buy Back occurs before operations commence As anticipated the third party claimant has named Trident as a party to the existing litigation between Orion Resource Partners regarding the GRR The seller of the royalty has provided Trident with an indemnity subject to customary limitations and exclusions in respect of such proceedings Lake Rebecca Gold Project Apollo Consolidated Ltd Apollo the project operator has committed a material budget increase to advance the Lake Rebecca Gold Project 7 Lake Rebecca de risking the route to a future development decision Apollo has entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell its royalty interest over the Seguela Gold Project in Cote D Ivoire for A 20M cash It stated that the sale will add to existing cash reserves placing Apollo in a very strong position to take Rebecca forward Apollo announced the strategic acquisition of additional land tenure around Lake Rebecca to allow for full operational and planning flexibility as the company moves towards commercial studies 8 Apollo recently issued a JORC 2012 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate MRE update providing a 50 increase in Indicated Mineral Resources to 815 000 ounces to a combined total indicated and inferred optimised pit constrained 1 105M ounces gold Mineral Resource 9 The MRE update also noted the commencement of key technical studies to progress a potential 8 year mining and processing operation With A 37 1M in cash and receivables on hand Apollo remains well funded to aggressively advance Lake Rebecca 9 Additional geotechnical drilling on the eastern side of the Lake Rebecca deposit will assist in the outline of an optimised open pit shell for the proposed mine drilling has intersected wide zones of high grade gold mineralisation in two diamond drill holes located in the footwall of the Jennifer Structure 10 Apollo has stated the results from the two holes open potential for previously unknown structures to the east of the current resource with intersections up to 16m 4 12g t Au and 7 4m 4 70g t Au respectively Geotechnical drilling elsewhere on the project also intersected significant gold mineralisation Spring Hill Gold Project Trident notes the receipt of environmental approval for the Spring Hill Gold Project Spring Hill under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act EPBC The approval represents the achievement of a key milestone in the development of Spring Hill clearing the way for next steps toward development Pukaqaqa Copper Project Nexa Resources SA the project operator noted in its 2020 annual filing that the first part of pre feasibility metallurgical results for the Pukaqaqa Copper Project were concluded in December 2020 demonstrating better results than previous campaigns including improved recoveries and grades During 2021 variability tests to confirm results will be held The project budget has been increased by 60 from 2020 to US 2 4 million in 2021 to allow for further metallurgical testing and environmental closure works in the drilling area 11 Warrawoona Gold Project Calidus Resources Ltd Calidus the project operator is completing an integration study on its Blue Spec gold deposit to assess the economics of mining Blue Spec and trucking ore to the nearby Warrawoona plant potentially increasing the robustness of Warrawoona by increasing operating margins 12 In addition Caldius noted in its corporate presentation that Warrawoona will commence main construction this quarter as well as confirming that construction is fully funded and on schedule to pour first gold as planned in the first half of 2022 Mosquito Creek Gold Project Calidus has entered into a Farm In Agreement with Nimble Resources 13 the project operator which gives Calidus the right to earn up to 90 of the Mosquito Creek tenement E46 1035 located about 75km from its Warrawoona gold project and in the vicinity of the Blue Spec mining proposition E46 1035 is located along strike of two geochemical trends identified on tenements immediately to the west Calidus states that many soil and rock chip anomalies on the tenement have not been previously followed up with drilling and fieldwork will start in earnest this calendar year Koolyanobbing Iron Ore Project In its Q3 FY2021 quarterly results 14 Mineral Resources Limited stated that 2 5 million tonnes of iron ore were shipped from the Yilgarn Hub for the quarter Trident holds a 1 5 free on board royalty over the M77 1259 tenement which covers a substantial part of the Deception pit which forms part of the broader Koolyanobbing iron ore operation in Western Australia Mimbula Copper Project Production continues to ramp up at the Mimbula Copper Project and with the copper price recently touching near 10 year highs supported by solid fundamentals the project is well positioned to capitalise on continued positive market sentiment Strong balance sheet to support future acquisitions Unaudited cash balance of US 7 4 million as of 31 March 2021 not inclusive of Q1 royalty revenue which was received post quarter end This substantial cash balance coupled with ongoing projected revenues from two cash generative royalties and an ability to offer vendors publicly tradeable equity in Trident supports capacity for future acquisitions In addition Trident entered into a term sheet with Tribeca Global Resources Credit Pty Ltd during Q1 in respect of a proposed debt facility up to an amount of US 10 million The Facility is subject to the finalisation of definitive documents and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent Indicative of the strength of the pipeline Trident currently has 11 active NDAs under which it is reviewing a range of opportunities across commodities including mineral sands lead nickel copper gold zinc cobalt potash and iron ore and Trident continues to prioritise production or near production assets in order to materially build Trident s near term revenue profile Adam Davidson Chief Executive Officer of Trident commented The first quarter of 2021 was perhaps the most significant for Trident since its admission to trading on AIM less than a year ago with the 28 million acquisition of 60 of the Thacker Pass lithium royalty coupled with a substantial equity raise The fundraising was conducted at no discount to the prevailing share price was significantly oversubscribed and has resulted in a number of new institutional holders establishing a position in the Company In addition to funding our Thacker Pass transaction we have a very healthy balance sheet to support the continued growth and diversification of our royalty portfolio both through acquisition as well as positive asset level progress This bodes exceptionally well for Trident particularly against a global macro backdrop that is increasingly supportive of growing demand for critical commodities Within the last quarter we ve seen material positive updates at Lake Rebecca Spring Hill and the Western Australian Gold Royalty package tenements Revenue continues to remain volatile across Trident s two paying royalties a factor which underpins the opportunity available to Trident by which it can acquire single asset royalties at attractive valuations from natural sellers to ultimately construct a diversified portfolio of royalties with a more predictable payment profile Trident remains focused on executing value accretive transactions across the commodity and development space with a particular focus on enhancing near term revenue References 1 Inclusive of GST 2 Source Trident Royalties announcement dated 29

investors with exposure to a mix of base and precious metals bulk materials excluding thermal coal and battery metals Key highlights of Trident s strategy include Building a royalty and streaming portfolio to broadly mirror the commodity exposure of the global mining sector excluding thermal coal with a bias towards production or near production assets differentiating Trident from the majority of peers which are exclusively or heavily weighted to precious metals Acquiring royalties and streams in resource friendly jurisdictions worldwide while most competitors have portfolios focused on North and South America Targeting attractive small to mid size transactions which are often ignored in a sector dominated by large players Active deal sourcing which in addition to writing new royalties and streams will focus on the acquisition of assets held by natural sellers such as closed end funds prospect generators junior and mid tier miners holding royalties as non core assets and counterparties seeking to monetise packages of royalties and streams which are otherwise undervalued by the market Maintaining a low overhead model which is capable of supporting a larger scale business without a commensurate increase in operating costs and Leveraging the experience of management the board of directors and Trident s adviser team all of whom have deep industry connections and strong transactional experience across multiple commodities and jurisdictions The acquisition and aggregation of individual royalties and streams is expected to deliver strong returns for shareholders as assets are acquired on terms reflective of single asset risk compared with the lower risk profile of a diversified larger scale portfolio Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt Once scale has been achieved strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection growth and income Forward looking Statements This news release contains forward looking information The statements are based on reasonable assumptions and
