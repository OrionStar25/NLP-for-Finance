      "Originally posted by kervio I think the update said median age of the first set of patients was around mid 50s and median age of the later set of patients was around 69 so they would have only had to have put the inclusion criteria in half way through the trial when the evidence was emerging that age was a huge factor in deaths in order to have a successful trial This is the big what if that might have sent the SP to 10 FDA approval lives saved etc We can give them a pass on not knowing that up front for sure because of the speed in which the trial moved forwards on but I think some reactivity would have saved the day here once more was known about covid in the same way that we found out about comorbidities leading to higher rates of death I disagree with this This disease has been totally wacky in respect of different age cohorts and no one has or has had any idea what is going to happen to any given age group once confronted with the disease or results impact COVID has everyone flummoxed until the Brazil variant turned everything on its head which happened after the trial there was lots of clear evidence in white papers about the effect of age on covid mortality The inclusion criteria is there to stop random chance from derailing your study so if they had say 10 or so 80yo patients that were enrolled and bound to die no matter what it lessons the effect of your treatment on a saveable demographic within your cohort I agree with your excitement on what the results though and I think this therapy has some big potential to show effect and get approval in a confirmatory trial with appropriate design It s better than I expected the results to be Expand Hey Good points on age effect I guess I was thinking more broadly say in respect of MIS C in kids under 50s getting blood clots with the Astra Zeneca and J J vaccines etc A lot about COVID has been very unpredictable As well we don t know what conversations if any were had between MSB NIH the FDA and the DSMB Clearly someone made the decision not to modify the inclusion criteria and continue the trial opting to halt it instead Most likely NOT MSB s choice and I doubt they would have been given enough information by the DSMB to allow them to make this call on their own I am clearly not qualified to speak on the issue of course LeftYahoo had a good point about the silver lining here though we get the full trial results that much earlier with it having been halted Fingers crossed the NIH the FDA and Novartis are as excited about these amazing results as we are\n",

      "What s your role in AngloGold Ashanti Sam Jonah questioned After his public address to Rotary Club in Accra Sam Kwesi Esson Jonah KBE has come under immense criticism from persons close to the government who feel that portions of his address attacked the Executive The latest criticism is coming from Paul Adom Otchere host of Good Evening Ghana GEG who in his biweekly show on Metro TV tried to punch holes in the senior stateman s speech According to him Sam Jonah KBE must have had a role in Ashanti Gold which later turned into AngloGold Ashanti therefore he should be able to tell the young people of Ghana the role he played while working with the company On his show Thursday April 29 2021 Adom Otchere stated that if Sam Jonah KBE wants to talk about the future of Ghana then he must first of all open up about his past Sam Jonah cannot come and talk about the future without answering questions about his past it behoves him to make statements about his past If he won t say anything at all at least we know his role with Adisadel College and AshGold Football Club we do not know his role in that major transaction that has punctuated the corporate and political history of our society the Ashanti transaction Paul Adom Otchere said on his show monitored by GhanaWeb He indicated that there are two Ashanti transactions one was failed by the government of Ghana which left a lot of rancour s between JJ Rawlings and Sam Jonah and their relationship broke off completely We don t know the details Sam Jonah must come and tell us And then the transaction was rehashed and relaunched in 2001 and 2002 this time it was supported by the JA Kufuor government and it was successful In both transactions there was a critical decision about the heritage of the Ghanaian young person because this gold resource which is a Ghanaian resource was being treated in a certain way was it being treated in the right way to guarantee the future of the young people that today Sam Jonah is concerned about Was it being treated in a certain way that eventually guaranteed our future Was there an option with Randgold resources and other people who wanted to participate that could have been better for the future of Ghana he asked Adom Otchere stressed that Sam Jonah KBE must answer these questions He Sam Jonah is a big man he has been around for a very long time and he comes and says the youth of Ghana I now feel the responsibility to speak and you don t tell us what you ve been doing in the past when you have had such a tenacious relationship with the political decision making of Ghana since 1983 you won t tell us what has happened about that Paul Adom Otchere argues that Sam Jonah s answer to the question will help the Ghanaian youth understand whether or not he has found a new philosophy or a new idea So that we can understand whether the idea you present today is the idea that has been with you for a very long time If that idea that you present today is not an idea that has been with for a long time it is still a welcome idea but we want to know so that we put it on record because the record is important he stressed\n",

Japan For the fiscal year under review demand remained steady centering on public works on which the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic had a small impact Nevertheless sales declined from the previous fiscal year as adversely affected by slack private sector construction as well as limited sales and service activities in the first six month period Americas In North America sales dropped from the previous fiscal year While demand for construction equipment was on a recovery track in the housing sector and the rental industry it was adversely affected by sluggish economic conditions under the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic and that for construction and mining equipment remained slack in the energy related sector In Latin America demand for construction equipment remained steady in Brazil and sales of mining equipment increased to Chilean copper mines However sales declined from the previous fiscal year as mainly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic especially in the first six month period Europe and CIS In Europe sales decreased from the previous fiscal year as demand remained sluggish in the first six month period although demand was on a recovery track from the adverse effects of the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic in the major markets of Germany the United Kingdom and France as well as in Italy In CIS sales declined affected by sluggish demand for mining equipment in coal mines and depreciation of the Russian ruble while demand was steady in gold mines and that for construction equipment was on a recovery track in infrastructure development and energy related sectors China While the share of sales made by domestic manufacturers increased demand remained steady supported by the government s economic stimulus measures such as infrastructure investment after containing the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic Furthermore demand advanced in the fiscal year under review driven by the post Chinese New Year sales season in February and because the previous year s sales season in February was pushed back by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic As a result sales increased from the previous fiscal year Asia and Oceania In Asia demand showed steady recovery centering on construction equipment in Indonesia Thailand and Malaysia and some signs of recovery for mining equipment emerged in coal mines in Indonesia in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of recovering coal prices However sales dropped sharply from the previous fiscal year as particularly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic in the first six month period In Oceania sales increased supported by steady demand for mining equipment in iron ore mines as well as for construction equipment Middle East and Africa In the Middle East sales improved from the previous fiscal year supported by steady demand especially in Turkey while demand remained slack in Saudi Arabia largely affected by sluggish crude oil prices and the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic In Africa demand for construction equipment remained slack in Southern Africa mainly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic While some signs of recovery of demand surfaced in other regions sales declined as affected by reduced sales of mining equipment as well Retail Finance While assets increased reflecting an increase in new contracts centering on North America as well as the affects of foreign exchange rates in the fourth quarter revenues decreased by 6 4 from the previous fiscal year to JPY 66 3 billion as affected by a drop in new contracts in the nine month period Segment profit fell by 16 6 to JPY 10 5 billion mainly reflecting the adverse effects of an extension of payments and revaluation of vehicles after lease use Industrial Machinery and Others For the fiscal year under review sales fell by 3 6 from the previous fiscal year to JPY 171 2 billion This was mainly affected by slack capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses sheet metal machines and machine tools as well as their delayed installation at customers overseas workplaces especially under the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic Meanwhile segment profit increased by 19 3 to JPY 16 3 billion as sales remained steady for Excimer laser related business in the semiconductor market Projections for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31 2022 From April 1 2021 to March 31 2022 In the construction mining and utility equipment business Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase as it believes that demand will continue to recover from the fiscal year under review returning to the level prior to the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic By region Komatsu anticipates demand will expand especially in Asia North America and Latin America In China Komatsu expects that demand will decline from the fiscal year under review when the post Chinese New Year sales season occurred twice Nevertheless Komatsu projects that global demand will increase from the fiscal year under review Furthermore Komatsu projects that demand for mining equipment will remain steady in iron ore copper and gold mines while it will enter a recovery track in coal mines With respect to profits Komatsu expects that they will advance reflecting an increase in volume of sales differences in composition of sales and improved selling prices In the retail finance business Komatsu anticipates both sales and segment profit will improve mainly due to an increase in new contracts In the industrial machinery and others business Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase as sales of machine tools and the Excimer laser related business should grow respectively in the automobile manufacturing industry and on the semiconductor market As preconditions for its projection Komatsu is assuming the foreign exchange rates

    "Above, we list 10 random articles that treat `gold` as a tradable commodity (retrieved by the algorithm above). However, we see that there still exists some false positives that weren't eliminated:\n",
    "- If you want soft skin for the rest of your days invest in some Gold Bond Ultimate Healing lotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because of the following limitations of the algorithm above:\n",
    "1. The `context` is not an exhaustive list, i.e., many other words/phrases can be associated with `gold` and `silver` in the financial domain. More descriptive contexts help to gauge the type of article better.\n",
    "2. I perform exact string-matching for context words (syntax matching) instead of semantic-matching. This can lead to misleading examples (false positives), e.g., \n",
    "- \"I *rate* the movie \"*Gold* Rush\" 4/5.\" (context word is `rate`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following methods can be implemented to make the above algorithm more robust:\n",
    "1. Increasing the `context` list with more relevant financial terms/phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Changing the algorithm to check for bigrams, trigrams instead of single context keywords, e.g., \"Gold Bond Ultimate\" is not a financial term.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check the entity class of gold - we only want `nouns`, not adverbs such as \"sounds gold\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Instead of exact string-matching, first lemmatize every word and then use syntax-matching. This helps to lower the size of the `context` list too, e.g., `buy` == `bought`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Instead of choosing articles that contain ATLEAST ONE context words, choose articles that contain ATLEAST K context words - add thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Represent articles and context using word embeddings (e.g., BERT) and calculate cosine similarity between them to perform semantic-matching."

    "The following issues can be seen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most of the `gold` instances in the false positives are organizational entities, e.g., \n",
    "    - Gold Price News `ORG`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The actual commodities are not even being recognized by spacy as any entity. This means we need to extend spacy's default implementation to identify products/commodities as entities, e.g., \n",
    "    - \"Every post and comment you have ever made was related to persuading people to buy silver\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is possible that if entity `CARDINAL` is present then the commodity might be present too. However, this is a naive assumption and may lead to false positives, e.g. \n",
    "    - gold standard is 100 USD.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Therefore, the following solutions can be used to provide NER for out-of-sample datasets (OOD) - where a naive `context` list may not sufficiently work well:\n",
    "1. Extend `spacy`'s in-built implementation to extract entities that mention items as commodities.\n",
    "2. Leverage a pre-trained LLM:\n",
    "    - It has learnt representations and entities from vast out-of-sample databases, thereby providing a generalized solution.\n",
    "    - Inference the LLM using a simple NER query related to tradable commodities containing gold and silver.\n",
    "    \n",
    "`spacy-llm` combines the above 2 approaches and provides a scalable solution for OOD NER. It has the following components:\n",
    "1. A config file which specifies the following (see `fewshot.cfg` for details):\n",
    "    - LLM to be used\n",
    "    - The prompt to the LLM\n",
    "    - The custom entity labels, e.g., `GOLD`, `SILVER`, `PRODUCT`, etc\n",
    "    - The definition and description of the labels\n",
    "2. An examples file containing multiple examples of which entity is used in every scenario (see `examples.yml` for details). This helps to build a fewshot prompt for the LLM.\n",

DECREASE OF THE NET INCOME DUE TO DISAPPOINTING OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL AND INDIA NON AUDITED KEY CONSOLIDATED FIGURES 20 20 201 9 Var Revenues EUR m 2 5 2 8 12 EBITDA EUR m 2 0 1 4 4 5 Net Income EUR m 2 1 3 6 4 1 Shareholders Equity EUR m 1 16 1 21 4 Cash and Financial assets 10 5 103 1 closed 2020 with a net result Group share of EUR 2 1m compared to EUR 3 6m in 2019 This decline essentially stems from on one hand a drop of the Brazilian operational result due to a very low generation coupled with a massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency and on the other hand an increase of the impairment of the Indian projects leading to an overall decline of the result The EBITDA is also down by 45 EUR 2 0m in 2020 vs EUR 1 4 m in 2019 Net financial gains which amounted to EUR 7 7m were almost stable compared to EUR 8 1m in 2019 mostly because of the reallocation of the portfolio from corporate bonds to equity and commodities Shareholder s equity decreased by 4 mainly due to the share buyback programs executed in 2020 492 k shares bought back in 2020 for a total price of EUR 3 1m During 2020 the continued developing its hydropower concessions located in India 571 MW and operated its Rodeio Bonito hydropower plant 15 MW in Brazil The uncertainties and deadlocks of the Indian hydropower market remained as in 2019 and prevented progress of the projects leading to an additional provision or Eur 2 8 million 20 for FY 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 considering the previously booked provisions This additional provision was already accounted for in the 2020 half yearly results published in October 2020 The Rodeio Bonito plant generation was historically low 40 below the 2019 generation as a result of the severe draught in the south of Brazil which led to an increase of the payments to the MRE system 1 At constant foreign exchange rates the turnover has grown 18 thanks to the inflation of selling prices In Euro the turnover is down by 12 EUR 2 5 m in 2020 vs EUR 2 8 m in 2019 because of the massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency in 2020 41 FINANCIAL YEAR 20 20 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE BUSINESS India The hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the State of Arunachal Pradesh could not make significant progress due to several long lasting administrative and regulatory impediments aggravated by the Covid 19 pandemic The Techno Economic Clearance TEC Environmental Clearance Forest Clearance as well as most of the post TEC investigations being complete for the tandem Heo Tato 1 426 MW the main next development steps for these 2 projects are the land acquisition the transport infrastructure the amendment of the concession agreements the stage 2 Forest Clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable Power Purchase Agreement PPA These steps however essentially fall under the purview and responsibility of the State and Central Governments During 2020 the land acquisition procedure conducted by the State Government was halted due to a stoppage of the land survey by several land owners who physically prevented the District administration to enter some parts of the land complaining about land ownership disputes and claiming immediate financial compensations The discussions initiated between the state government and the concerned owners in February 2020 were suspended due to the Covid 19 outbreak as the required meetings could happen only physically The procedure could restart only in February 2021 All the on site surveys and boundary markings were completed by the in March 2021 without interruption As of the date of this press release the Group has not received the official survey report and list of land owners from the However the Group s team attended each survey and it is the Group understanding that significant parts of the land requirement have again been registered by the as being under ownership dispute and that the survey may lead to an increase of disputed areas as compared to earlier lists established by the State Government The Group does not know yet if and how the Government of Arunachal Pradesh GoAP will settle these disputes and find a solution that will allow permanent site access and the Projects implementation considers that as per the current concession agreement and applicable regulations the land acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the exclusive responsibility of the licensing Government The concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer Negotiations with the GoAP for the amendment of the concession agreement relate to the development timeframe but also to the amendment of the allocated capacities still 380MW in the current concession agreement and other important terms have not progressed since 2018 This has led to the impossibility to renew the TECs of the Heo and Tato 1 426 MW tandem in 2020 as such renewal required either a concession agreement up to date with the 426 MW capacity approved by CEA or a non objection certificate NOC from the GoAP TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP granted in 2015 for 3 years and already extended a first time in 2018 for 2 years were bearing validities until on 27 th July 2020 and 28 th October 2020 respectively Applications for renewals of both TECs were submitted to CEA which requested the Group to obtain from GoAP a NOC acknowledging that the GoAP has no objection to the renewal of the projects TECs for the current capacities of 240 MW and 186 MW After several discussions the GoAP refused on 1 st October 2020 to issue a NOC unless the concession agreements were amended under conditions entailing significant financial costs some of which the Group does not agree with After requesting a draft amendment to the GoAP during Q4 2020 without success the Group finally sent its own proposed draft amendment in Q1 2021 Its main provisions relate to the allocated installed capacities the administrative fees the development timeframe the obligations of both parties and the increase of the free power to the GoAP against the withdrawal of its potential equity participation in the projects The provisions have been proposed by the Group considering the historical difficulties and the ground reality of the projects and of the Indian hydropower market As of the date of this press release the discussions are going on with the GoAP but both TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP are technically not valid anymore and their renewal is depending on the execution of the revised concession agreement in addition to the CEA renewal procedure The road infrastructures have kept progressing at a slow pace during 2020 as they did in previous years No progress has been made by the regarding the acceleration of the overall completion schedule The scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade up to the projects site are still scheduled theoretically in 2022 but will most likely face significant delays of 2 to 3 years given that for some stretches the technical studies have not yet even been completed On the forest clearance side the renewal of the stage I clearance has been applied for in September 2020 and is still under progress as of date The Group continued to explore the Indian market and to conduct its preliminary search for a PPA during 2020 All the major Indian power traders PPA brokers and distribution companies DISCOMS contacted for Heo and Tato 1 either declined to take up a commercial discussion for a PPA or did not respond The continued lack of appetite of the market for hydropower PPAs results from the commercial and financial Indian market conditions which remained the same during 2020 and still do not fulfil the requirements for the long term and bankable sale of hydropower The market remained constrained by the lack of appropriate regulatory framework for such bankable PPAs the stressed financial position of electricity distribution companies DISCOMS and the indirect competition of cheap solar and wind power Grid stability and the requirement for peak power 2 have also become a growing issue for Run of the River ROR hence with no storage hydro projects such as Heo and Tato 1 HEPs Two years after the announcement of the new hydropower policy by the a first part of the long awaited implementation regulation has finally be issued imposing a Hydropower Purchase Obligation HPO on DISCOMS setting a percentage of power that shall be procured by them from hydropower sources between 2021 and 2030 These percentages range from 0 18 to 2 82 and are remarkably lower than those of solar power currently at 10 25 for 2021 The question is raised within the industry whether these provisions will be sufficient to trigger a general revival of the hydropower sector and enough demand for long term bankable PPAs for projects which are not yet under construction Despite the above issues the Group s projects are the only hydropower projects of such size in India owned and developed by a foreign investor They are amongst the most advanced private projects and present competitive techno economic and environmental features Despite long term promising prospects the current Indian power market and especially the hydropower sector are still characterized by a lot of uncertainties The Groups projects have been heavily delayed several years in a row These delays and uncertainties have been reflected in an additional provision of Eur 2 8 million 20 of gross value decided for first semester 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 of gross value considering the cumulated provisions booked in previous years EUR 4 4m or 30 of gross value The Indian projects activities have been detailed in chapter I 4 1 of the annual report available at Brazil The Rodeio Bonito Hydropower plant 15 MW recorded a historically low production of 29 496 MWh in 2020 40 below the 2019 generation 49 113 MWh in 2019 and close to its all time record low of 2012 24 793 MWh However the turnover when expressed in the Brazilian currency BRL was up thanks to the inflation and the MRE system But as a result of this very low electricity generation and the national low hydro generation in 2020 the plant had to compensate the MRE system which was in a negative position This is why payments to the MRE were much higher reaching EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 As a result the EBITDA of the plant amounted to BRL 8 1m against BRL 9 3m in 2019 down by 13 When converted in euro the EBITDA of the plant was significantly lower to EUR 1 4m vs 2 1m in 2019 51 mostly due to a 34 depreciation of the average rate of the Brazilian Real vs Euro currency in 2020 Financial Assets also continued to manage actively its treasury throughout a complicated year marked by the Covid 19 pandemic and its impact on the financial markets The Group executed an important reallocation of its investments in other asset classes The Group started the year with a portfolio invested at approximately 60 in bonds mostly high yield corporate ones This bond portfolio was reduced by approximately half in January and February as the rewards seemed not any more commensurate with the potential default risks Since the March 2020 market crunch the Group has gradually changed its asset allocation to include more exposure to equity and commodities mostly gold As of 31 st December 2020 the bonds exposure including T bills was reduced to 19 of the portfolio 64 as of 31 12 19 whereas the rest of the portfolio of cash financial assets and financial liabilities EUR 104 5 m included a negative net cash position of EUR 9 3 m 9 of the portfolio versus a positive net debt position of EUR 27 2 m in 2019 25 of the portfolio 19 of gold related exposure versus 1 as of 31 12 2019 21 of oil related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 4 of silver related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 42 of equity excluding oil long positions 7 as of 31 12 2019 4 of equity short positions 2 in 2019 1 in private equity and credit 3 in 2019 While reallocating its financial assets towards equity the Group has invested in companies which were trading at historically low prices and could benefit from the improvement of the Covid 19 situation The two sectors hence selected were banking and energy This strategy of reallocation of the financial assets proved profitable as the Group net financial assets rose from Eur 103 million to Eur 105 million and the financial result amounted to EUR 7 7 m as of 31 12 2020 stable when compared to 2019 EUR 8 1 m and despite the COVID 19 crisis Given the current very low levels of benchmark rates in all developed markets USA Europe and Japan the Group does not anticipate it will increase again its investments in corporate bonds in the medium term The Group has reduced significantly its financial exposure to the USD and increased its exposure to the Euro and the Japanese Yen As of 31 12 2020 the Group financial assets were exposed notably to the US Dollars 35 against 67 in 2019 the Japanese Yen 25 against 2 in 2019 and the Euro 22 against 9 in 2019 It is to be noted that the Gold and Silver positions are priced in USD and as such are included in the former USD exposure Contrary to the previous years the Group has fully invested its cash and has used some leverage see above net cash position The financial portfolio is detailed in part I section 3 1 B of the annual report 2020 available at During the year continued to execute buyback programs in order to provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to sell their shares The shares are bought back in view of their cancellation or to cover for new grants of free shares A total of 492 348 shares were bought back in 2020 for a total price of Eur 3 131 696 275 000 shares were cancelled in April 2020 and as of 31 st December 2020 held 314 023 own shares representing 5 66 of its share capital Foreseeable evolution of the Group After the closing of this financial year the Group is pursuing the following main objectives as a priority for FY 2021 Pursuing the development of the Indian hydropower projects On the short term executing the required amendment to the concession agreements of the Indian hydropower projects in order to secure the renewal of the TECs and the renewal of Forest clearances Continue the active management of its diversified financial investments The ability of the Group to pursue these objectives is subject to the evolution of the current Covid 19 crisis which may affect both the development of the Indian projects and the financial portfolio FINANCIAL YEAR 2020 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Statement unaudited consolidated Turnover amounted to EUR 2 5m against EUR 2 8m in 2018 a 12 decrease mainly from electricity sales in Brazil The turnover in local currency increased by 18 with the inflation on electricity sale prices However the depreciation of the Brazilian currency vs the Euro currency was responsible for a 34 decrease of the turnover in Euro The current operating result amounted to EUR 5 6m against 4 3m in 2019 Payments to the MRE Energy Reallocation Mechanism were EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 Depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets of Rodeio Bonito plant amounted to EUR 0 5m EUR 0 7m in 2019 while depreciation on

Group employed on average 20 permanent employees in 2020 External expenses are totaling EUR 1 4m in 2020 vs EUR 1 5m in 2019 Net Financial Gain for the group amounted to EUR 7 7m in 2020 mostly because of the reallocation strategy from bonds to equity and commodities markets and despite the USD depreciation 9 compared to end of 2019 and its impact on the Group s cash and financial assets position The impact of this depreciation has been managed by the currency reallocation strategy of the Group avoiding bigger potential forex losses see breakdown per currency in chapter I 7 4 of the annual report This gain of 7 7m compares to EUR 8 1m in 2019 In 2020 other operating income EUR 0 2m consisted mainly of earn out gains on Brazilian assets related to Brazilian assets divested in previous years This figure was NIL in 2019 Income tax expense amounted to EUR 0 2m in 2020 same as in 2019 The net result Group share was EUR 2 1m in 2020 FY compared to EUR 3 6m in 2019 The Group s EBITDA reached EUR 2 0m compared to EUR 1 4m in 2019 The strong depreciation of BRL 41 and INR Indian Currency 12 closing rates when compared to Euro at 2020 closing date has heavily and negatively impacted the other comprehensive income as the Group s main tangible and intangible investments have been done in local currency EUR 4 5m in 2020 against EUR 0 1m in 2019 The total comprehensive income amounts to a loss of EUR 2 4m in 2020 against a gain of EUR 3 5m in 2019 Balance sheet Assets unaudited consolidated Net intangible assets stands at 8 3m in 2020 and are down by EUR 3 7m versus

costs on Indian projects Net tangible assets stands at 5 3m in 2020 and decreased by EUR 2 7m between 2019 and 2020 mainly because of depreciation of the Rodeio Bonito plant EUR 0 5m and the depreciation of the Brazilian currency EUR 2 3m Cash cash equivalent assets and financial assets net of Current financial liabilities have increased from EUR 103m in 2019 to EUR 105m in 2020 1 mainly thanks the good performance of the Group s financial portfolio and despite the share buyback programs Financial assets consist mainly in listed equity bonds and commodities related stocks Finally total assets increased by 15 3 during 2020 FY up by EUR 18 9 m mostly because of the bank overdraft facility described in below as part of the liabilities and the related asset purchases At 31 st December 2020 the Group and its subsidiaries holds 314 023 own shares 2019 146 810 At year end closing price of EUR 6 41 those own shares have a market value of EUR 2 0m Balance sheet Liabilities

accumulated interests and judicial expenses Trade and other payables amount to EUR 0 9 m vs EUR 0 5m in 2019 due to EUR 0 3 m of payable related to MRE payments in Brazil due in early 2021 but related to 2020 generation Current financial liabilities of EUR 23 9 m in 2020 vs NIL in 2019 are related to overdraft facilities granted by a brokerage firm to the Group to leverage its listed investments trading activities Under this facility securities held in the trading account are used as a security to borrow money This facility has enabled the Group to leverage its investments and maximize its profits But it is to be noted that leverage works both ways and could also cause higher losses in case of fall in market prices Own shares booked directly against the equity of the Group at their historical cost reduce the net shareholder s equity of the Group by EUR 2 1m at 31 st December 2020 versus EUR 1 2m at 31 st December 2019 following the share buyback programs EUR 3 1m the capital

the reputational blight All the while ransomware gangsters have become more brazen and cocky as they put more and more lives and livelihoods at risk This week one syndicate threatened to make available to local criminal gangs data they say they stole from the Washington D C metro police on informants Another recently offered to share data purloined from corporate victims with Wall Street inside traders Cybercriminals have even reached out directly to people whose personal info was harvested from third parties to pressure victims to pay up In general the ransomware actors have gotten more bold and more ruthless said Allan Liska an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future On April 29 a public private task force including Microsoft Amazon the National Governors Association the FBI Secret Service and Britain and Canada s elite crime agencies delivered to the White House an 81 page urgent action plan for an aggressive and comprehensive whole of government assault on ransomware At the report s online launch Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a pre recorded video that the White House is developing a plan for disrupting ransomware and his department will work to implement many of the panel s recommendations because one thing is clear Ransomware is a threat to our national security Mayorkas last month announced a DHS ransomware initiative and the Department of Justice has just created a task force to tackle the scourge Where did ransomware come from How does it work The criminal syndicates that dominate the ransomware business are mostly Russian speaking and operate with near impunity out of Russia and allied countries They are a continuation and refinement ransomware was barely a blip three years ago of more than two decades of cyber thieving that spammed stole credit cards and identities and emptied bank accounts The syndicates have grown in sophistication and skill leveraging dark web forums to organise and recruit while hiding their identities and movements with tools like the Tor browser and cryptocurrencies that make payments and their laundering harder to track Ransomware scrambles a victim organisation s data with encryption The criminals leave instructions on infected computers for how to negotiate ransom payments and once paid provide software decryption keys Last year ransomware crooks expanded into data theft blackmail Before triggering encryption they quietly exfiltrate sensitive files and threaten to expose them publicly unless ransoms are paid Victims who diligently backed up their networks as a hedge against ransomware now had to think twice about refusing to pay At the end of 2019 only one ransomware group had an extortion site online that would publish such files Now more than two dozen do Victims who refuse to pay can incur costs that far exceed the ransoms they might have negotiated It happened recently to the University of Vermont Health Network It suffered an estimated US 1 5mil a day in losses in the two months it took to recover More than 5 000 hospital computers their data scrambled into gibberish had to be wiped clean and reconstituted from backed up data The University of California San Francisco heavily involved in Covid 19 research barely hesitated before paying It gave the criminals US 1 1mil last June Manufacturers have been especially hard hit this year with ransoms of US 50mil demanded of computer makers Acer and Quanta a major supplier of Apple laptops How are these criminals organised Some top ransomware criminals fancy themselves software service professionals They take pride in their customer service providing help desks that assist paying victims in file decryption And they tend to keep their word They have brands to protect after all If they stick to their promises future victims will be encouraged to pay up Maurits Lucas director of intelligence solutions at the cybersecurity firm Intel471 told a webinar earlier this year As a victim you actually know their reputation The business tends to be compartmentalised An affiliate will identify map out and infect targets choose victims and deploy ransomware that is typically rented from a ransomware as a service provider The provider gets a cut of the payout the affiliate normally taking more than three quarters Other subcontractors may also get a slice That can include the authors of the malware used to break into victim networks and the people running the so called bulletproof domains behind which the ransomware gangs hide their command and control servers Those servers manage the remote sowing of malware and data extraction ahead of activation a stealthy process that can take weeks Why do ransoms keep climbing How can they be stopped In Thursday s report the task force says it would be wrong to try to ban ransom payments largely because ransomware attackers continue to find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack The task force recognises that paying up can be the only way for an afflicted business to avoid bankruptcy Worse the sophisticated cybercriminals often have done their research and know a victim s cybersecurity insurance coverage limit They ve been known to mention it in negotiations That degree of criminal savvy helped drive average ransom payments to more than US 310 000 last year up 171 from 2019 according to Palo Alto Networks a task force member Not surprisingly the still young cyber insurance industry is reeling Premiums have gone up by 50 to 100 in the past year as ransomware became the No 1 claim said Michael Phillips chief claims officer of Resilience Insurance and a co chair of the task force On average cyber insurance claim payouts can now exceed 70 of what is paid in premiums prompting some insurers to drop this type of insurance altogether industry reports show The multi pronged response to ransomware proposed by the task force will require the kind of concerted diplomatic legal and law enforcement cooperation with key allies that the Trump administration shunned displacing what the authors call the current uncoordinated disjointed response There is no silver bullet but if we re going to shift the trajectory of this type of attack the US government has got to get at this with some speed said task force co chair Philip Reiner CEO of the nonprofit Institute for Security and Technology Ransomware developers and their affiliates should be named and shamed they are not always easy to identify and regimes that enable them punished with sanctions the report urges It calls for mandatory disclosure of ransom payments and a federal response fund to provide financial assistance to victims in hopes that in many cases it will prevent them from paying ransoms And it wants stricter regulation of cryptocurrency markets to make it more difficult for criminals to launder ransomware proceeds The task force also calls for something potentially controversial amending the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to let private industry actively block or limit online criminal activity including of botnets the networks of hijacked zombie computers that ransomware criminals use to sow infections The odds of successfully stifling ransomware are high the report s authors acknowledge The old adage that a cybercriminal only has to be lucky once while a defender has to be lucky every minute of every day has never been more true AP\n",

Trident Royalties Plc Trident or the Company Q1 2021 Activities Update Transformational Lithium Royalty Acquisition Fundraising Continued Strength in Commodities Trident Royalties Plc AIM TRR FSX 5KV is pleased to provide an update on its activities undertaken during the first quarter ended 31 March 2021 including Q1 royalty receipts HIGHLIGHTS Q1 saw a significant increase in battery metals exposure in conjunction with an oversubscribed equity financing Trident completed its most significant transaction to date with the acquisition of a 60 interest in a gross revenue royalty GRR over the Thacker Pass Project Thacker Pass for a total consideration of US 28 0 million comprising US 26 0 million in cash and US 2 0 million in new ordinary shares in Trident Thacker Pass contains the largest defined lithium Mineral Reserve in the United States A successful concurrent equity financing of approximately GBP20 7 million approximately US 28 8 million was conducted at no discount to the prevailing market price to execute the Thacker Pass lithium royalty transaction and strengthen the balance sheet Trident completed the Talga gold royalties transaction and shortly post quarter end completed the previously announced Pukaqaqa copper royalties transaction finalising the acquisition of these seven royalties and With a portfolio inclusive of copper iron ore gold and now lithium Trident is increasingly reflective of the broader global mining sector providing investors with an inflation hedge in the face of loose global monetary policy and direct exposure to a once in a generation energy revolution Q1 royalty payments totalling approximately US 451 314 from royalties over producing assets an increase of 55 over Q4 2020 Royalty Stream Q1 2021 Payment Cumulative Payments since Acquisition Koolyanobbing iron A 100 479 A 2 740 884 ore royalty 1 Mimbula copper royalty US 375 000 US 453 707 Mimbula copper royalty payment of US 375 000 based on the Minimum Payment Schedule MPS under the royalty agreement representing a significant increase over Q4 2020 Q1 2021 production saw 671 tonnes of copper sold an increase over Q4 2020 as the project continues to ramp up The MPS on the Mimbula copper royalty continues in 2021 US 375 000 per quarter in 2021 less any excess payments made above the MPS from previous quarters increasing to US 500 000 per quarter in 2022 and US 750 000 for the first two quarters of 2023 2 Koolyanobbing iron ore royalty payment of A 100 479 US 76 314 3 a decrease over Q4 2020 on higher received price but lower volumes from the royalty area Trident notes the average grade at Koolyanobbing has fallen from 59 to 57 Fe since 2H20 Recent unprecedented strength in the iron ore market particularly for low grade fines products may incentivise operators to opportunistically favour production from lower grade areas in the short term 4 Trident s royalty covers a substantial portion of the Deception pit the highest grade deposit and a significant proportion of the total Koolyanobbing reserves Trident anticipates deferred production of this higher quality ore will benefit the Company in the short medium term Trident also notes the recent strategy overview presentation by Mineral Resources Limited the project operator which highlighted the impending finalisation of a 10 year plan for the Yilgarn Hub of which Koolyanobbing and its associated infrastructure is the central component Additionally Mineral Resources flagged the expansion of the Yilgarn Hub to 12Mtpa as a further growth opportunity and Commodity prices underlying Trident s royalty portfolio remained strong throughout Q1 2021 with iron ore averaging US 131 tonne copper averaging 8 503 tonne lithium carbonate equivalent LCE averaging US 9 083 tonne and gold averaging US 1 793 oz 5 Post quarter end copper has continued to climb to near 10 year highs while LCE prices have now doubled year to date to over US 13 500 tonne Q1 royalty portfolio growth combined with positive asset level progress by project operators Thacker Pass Lithium Project 6 In January 2021 Lithium Americas Corp LAC the project operator announced the receipt of the final key federal permit for the project followed shortly thereafter by a US 400 million equity fundraise primarily to fund the commencement of construction With the acquisition of 60 of the GRR Trident now has exposure to a key global lithium asset with a clear pathway to production Other highlights include Thacker Pass currently contains a CIM compliant Mineral Reserve of 3 1Mt LCE the largest lithium reserve in the United States with an anticipated mine life of 46 years based on reserves Thacker Pass is at an advanced stage of development with a highly attractive Pre Feasibility Study PFS announced on 21 June 2018 and a Definitive Feasibility Study due for completion in 2021 LAC has announced that key permits are in place with commencement of construction targeted for late 2021 or early 2022 and Trident expects Phase 1 production to start ramping up in 2024 The GRR is subject to a partial operator buy back which Trident expects will be exercised by LAC for proceeds to Trident of US 13 2 million during the first year of operation the Buyback Based on the PFS parameters published by LAC including an LCE price of 12 000 tonne Phase 1 steady state royalty revenue attributable to Trident is anticipated to be approximately US 3 8 million per annum increasing to US 7 6 million per annum at Phase 2 steady state assuming the Buy Back occurs before operations commence As anticipated the third party claimant has named Trident as a party to the existing litigation between Orion Resource Partners regarding the GRR The seller of the royalty has provided Trident with an indemnity subject to customary limitations and exclusions in respect of such proceedings Lake Rebecca Gold Project Apollo Consolidated Ltd Apollo the project operator has committed a material budget increase to advance the Lake Rebecca Gold Project 7 Lake Rebecca de risking the route to a future development decision Apollo has entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell its royalty interest over the Seguela Gold Project in Cote D Ivoire for A 20M cash It stated that the sale will add to existing cash reserves placing Apollo in a very strong position to take Rebecca forward Apollo announced the strategic acquisition of additional land tenure around Lake Rebecca to allow for full operational and planning flexibility as the company moves towards commercial studies 8 Apollo recently issued a JORC 2012 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate MRE update providing a 50 increase in Indicated Mineral Resources to 815 000 ounces to a combined total indicated and inferred optimised pit constrained 1 105M ounces gold Mineral Resource 9 The MRE update also noted the commencement of key technical studies to progress a potential 8 year mining and processing operation With A 37 1M in cash and receivables on hand Apollo remains well funded to aggressively advance Lake Rebecca 9 Additional geotechnical drilling on the eastern side of the Lake Rebecca deposit will assist in the outline of an optimised open pit shell for the proposed mine drilling has intersected wide zones of high grade gold mineralisation in two diamond drill holes located in the footwall of the Jennifer Structure 10 Apollo has stated the results from the two holes open potential for previously unknown structures to the east of the current resource with intersections up to 16m 4 12g t Au and 7 4m 4 70g t Au respectively Geotechnical drilling elsewhere on the project also intersected significant gold mineralisation Spring Hill Gold Project Trident notes the receipt of environmental approval for the Spring Hill Gold Project Spring Hill under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act EPBC The approval represents the achievement of a key milestone in the development of Spring Hill clearing the way for next steps toward development Pukaqaqa Copper Project Nexa Resources SA the project operator noted in its 2020 annual filing that the first part of pre feasibility metallurgical results for the Pukaqaqa Copper Project were concluded in December 2020 demonstrating better results than previous campaigns including improved recoveries and grades During 2021 variability tests to confirm results will be held The project budget has been increased by 60 from 2020 to US 2 4 million in 2021 to allow for further metallurgical testing and environmental closure works in the drilling area 11 Warrawoona Gold Project Calidus Resources Ltd Calidus the project operator is completing an integration study on its Blue Spec gold deposit to assess the economics of mining Blue Spec and trucking ore to the nearby Warrawoona plant potentially increasing the robustness of Warrawoona by increasing operating margins 12 In addition Caldius noted in its corporate presentation that Warrawoona will commence main construction this quarter as well as confirming that construction is fully funded and on schedule to pour first gold as planned in the first half of 2022 Mosquito Creek Gold Project Calidus has entered into a Farm In Agreement with Nimble Resources 13 the project operator which gives Calidus the right to earn up to 90 of the Mosquito Creek tenement E46 1035 located about 75km from its Warrawoona gold project and in the vicinity of the Blue Spec mining proposition E46 1035 is located along strike of two geochemical trends identified on tenements immediately to the west Calidus states that many soil and rock chip anomalies on the tenement have not been previously followed up with drilling and fieldwork will start in earnest this calendar year Koolyanobbing Iron Ore Project In its Q3 FY2021 quarterly results 14 Mineral Resources Limited stated that 2 5 million tonnes of iron ore were shipped from the Yilgarn Hub for the quarter Trident holds a 1 5 free on board royalty over the M77 1259 tenement which covers a substantial part of the Deception pit which forms part of the broader Koolyanobbing iron ore operation in Western Australia Mimbula Copper Project Production continues to ramp up at the Mimbula Copper Project and with the copper price recently touching near 10 year highs supported by solid fundamentals the project is well positioned to capitalise on continued positive market sentiment Strong balance sheet to support future acquisitions Unaudited cash balance of US 7 4 million as of 31 March 2021 not inclusive of Q1 royalty revenue which was received post quarter end This substantial cash balance coupled with ongoing projected revenues from two cash generative royalties and an ability to offer vendors publicly tradeable equity in Trident supports capacity for future acquisitions In addition Trident entered into a term sheet with Tribeca Global Resources Credit Pty Ltd during Q1 in respect of a proposed debt facility up to an amount of US 10 million The Facility is subject to the finalisation of definitive documents and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent Indicative of the strength of the pipeline Trident currently has 11 active NDAs under which it is reviewing a range of opportunities across commodities including mineral sands lead nickel copper gold zinc cobalt potash and iron ore and Trident continues to prioritise production or near production assets in order to materially build Trident s near term revenue profile Adam Davidson Chief Executive Officer of Trident commented The first quarter of 2021 was perhaps the most significant for Trident since its admission to trading on AIM less than a year ago with the 28 million acquisition of 60 of the Thacker Pass lithium royalty coupled with a substantial equity raise The fundraising was conducted at no discount to the prevailing share price was significantly oversubscribed and has resulted in a number of new institutional holders establishing a position in the Company In addition to funding our Thacker Pass transaction we have a very healthy balance sheet to support the continued growth and diversification of our royalty portfolio both through acquisition as well as positive asset level progress This bodes exceptionally well for Trident particularly against a global macro backdrop that is increasingly supportive of growing demand for critical commodities Within the last quarter we ve seen material positive updates at Lake Rebecca Spring Hill and the Western Australian Gold Royalty package tenements Revenue continues to remain volatile across Trident s two paying royalties a factor which underpins the opportunity available to Trident by which it can acquire single asset royalties at attractive valuations from natural sellers to ultimately construct a diversified portfolio of royalties with a more predictable payment profile Trident remains focused on executing value accretive transactions across the commodity and development space with a particular focus on enhancing near term revenue References 1 Inclusive of GST 2 Source Trident Royalties announcement dated 29

investors with exposure to a mix of base and precious metals bulk materials excluding thermal coal and battery metals Key highlights of Trident s strategy include Building a royalty and streaming portfolio to broadly mirror the commodity exposure of the global mining sector excluding thermal coal with a bias towards production or near production assets differentiating Trident from the majority of peers which are exclusively or heavily weighted to precious metals Acquiring royalties and streams in resource friendly jurisdictions worldwide while most competitors have portfolios focused on North and South America Targeting attractive small to mid size transactions which are often ignored in a sector dominated by large players Active deal sourcing which in addition to writing new royalties and streams will focus on the acquisition of assets held by natural sellers such as closed end funds prospect generators junior and mid tier miners holding royalties as non core assets and counterparties seeking to monetise packages of royalties and streams which are otherwise undervalued by the market Maintaining a low overhead model which is capable of supporting a larger scale business without a commensurate increase in operating costs and Leveraging the experience of management the board of directors and Trident s adviser team all of whom have deep industry connections and strong transactional experience across multiple commodities and jurisdictions The acquisition and aggregation of individual royalties and streams is expected to deliver strong returns for shareholders as assets are acquired on terms reflective of single asset risk compared with the lower risk profile of a diversified larger scale portfolio Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt Once scale has been achieved strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection growth and income Forward looking Statements This news release contains forward looking information The statements are based on reasonable assumptions and

Japan For the fiscal year under review demand remained steady centering on public works on which the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic had a small impact Nevertheless sales declined from the previous fiscal year as adversely affected by slack private sector construction as well as limited sales and service activities in the first six month period Americas In North America sales dropped from the previous fiscal year While demand for construction equipment was on a recovery track in the housing sector and the rental industry it was adversely affected by sluggish economic conditions under the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic and that for construction and mining equipment remained slack in the energy related sector In Latin America demand for construction equipment remained steady in Brazil and sales of mining equipment increased to Chilean copper mines However sales declined from the previous fiscal year as mainly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic especially in the first six month period Europe and CIS In Europe sales decreased from the previous fiscal year as demand remained sluggish in the first six month period although demand was on a recovery track from the adverse effects of the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic in the major markets of Germany the United Kingdom and France as well as in Italy In CIS sales declined affected by sluggish demand for mining equipment in coal mines and depreciation of the Russian ruble while demand was steady in gold mines and that for construction equipment was on a recovery track in infrastructure development and energy related sectors China While the share of sales made by domestic manufacturers increased demand remained steady supported by the government s economic stimulus measures such as infrastructure investment after containing the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic Furthermore demand advanced in the fiscal year under review driven by the post Chinese New Year sales season in February and because the previous year s sales season in February was pushed back by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic As a result sales increased from the previous fiscal year Asia and Oceania In Asia demand showed steady recovery centering on construction equipment in Indonesia Thailand and Malaysia and some signs of recovery for mining equipment emerged in coal mines in Indonesia in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of recovering coal prices However sales dropped sharply from the previous fiscal year as particularly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic in the first six month period In Oceania sales increased supported by steady demand for mining equipment in iron ore mines as well as for construction equipment Middle East and Africa In the Middle East sales improved from the previous fiscal year supported by steady demand especially in Turkey while demand remained slack in Saudi Arabia largely affected by sluggish crude oil prices and the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic In Africa demand for construction equipment remained slack in Southern Africa mainly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic While some signs of recovery of demand surfaced in other regions sales declined as affected by reduced sales of mining equipment as well Retail Finance While assets increased reflecting an increase in new contracts centering on North America as well as the affects of foreign exchange rates in the fourth quarter revenues decreased by 6 4 from the previous fiscal year to JPY 66 3 billion as affected by a drop in new contracts in the nine month period Segment profit fell by 16 6 to JPY 10 5 billion mainly reflecting the adverse effects of an extension of payments and revaluation of vehicles after lease use Industrial Machinery and Others For the fiscal year under review sales fell by 3 6 from the previous fiscal year to JPY 171 2 billion This was mainly affected by slack capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses sheet metal machines and machine tools as well as their delayed installation at customers overseas workplaces especially under the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic Meanwhile segment profit increased by 19 3 to JPY 16 3 billion as sales remained steady for Excimer laser related business in the semiconductor market Projections for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31 2022 From April 1 2021 to March 31 2022 In the construction mining and utility equipment business Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase as it believes that demand will continue to recover from the fiscal year under review returning to the level prior to the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic By region Komatsu anticipates demand will expand especially in Asia North America and Latin America In China Komatsu expects that demand will decline from the fiscal year under review when the post Chinese New Year sales season occurred twice Nevertheless Komatsu projects that global demand will increase from the fiscal year under review Furthermore Komatsu projects that demand for mining equipment will remain steady in iron ore copper and gold mines while it will enter a recovery track in coal mines With respect to profits Komatsu expects that they will advance reflecting an increase in volume of sales differences in composition of sales and improved selling prices In the retail finance business Komatsu anticipates both sales and segment profit will improve mainly due to an increase in new contracts In the industrial machinery and others business Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase as sales of machine tools and the Excimer laser related business should grow respectively in the automobile manufacturing industry and on the semiconductor market As preconditions for its projection Komatsu is assuming the foreign exchange rates

previous fiscal year end to 50 5 For the fiscal year under review net cash provided by operating activities totaled JPY 354 1 billion an increase of JPY 58 9 billion from the previous fiscal year largely reflecting decreased inventories Net cash used in investing activities amounted to JPY 163 0 billion a decrease of JPY 27 8 billion from the previous fiscal year due mainly to the purchase of fixed assets Net cash used in financing activities amounted to JPY 199 6 billion as compared to JPY 3 4 billion used for the previous fiscal year mainly due to the repayment of debt and payment of

      "Gold standard swab tests will cost holidaymakers just 45 each Holidaymakers will be able to get a Covid test for just 45 under government plans to make holidays abroad more affordable when international travel opens up The PCR tests which are required on entry by most European countries would be provided for a fraction of the current price if the government s plan goes ahead the transport secretary said Gold standard PCR swab tests will continue to be required for all travellers arriving in Britain despite the Prime Minister previously suggesting that rapid lateral flow tests could be considered for use The news of cheaper tests for holidaymakers comes three weeks after Boris Johnson asked officials to consider using the on the spot rapid tests to make the tests more affordable stating that the reopening the holiday market from May 17 was a priority Grant Shapps the transport secretary announced the news on Thursday that a new entrant had made it possible to supply PCR tests for 44 40 Currently anyone coming to the UK has to take a pre flight test and buy a two swab package to be used two and eight days after arrival Official packages use gold standard PCR technology and cost around 200 a head this is due to fall to 45 by May 17 when some international travel is set to resume Shapps told the Commons I know that the House is interested on the update with regard to travel returning internationally and I wanted to provide a very quick update to say that although PCR tests may be required from a medical scientific point of view we have been working with private laboratories pharmacies supermarkets and other companies to encourage them to deliver on their logistical expertise and enter the market and drive down the cost We ve seen some success so far because the cost of a single PCR day two test now has come down to 60 from one of the large providers on the government linked site with a new entrant now at 44 90 enabling more people to access PCR tests as international travel returns The drop in price brings hope to the millions of Britons desperate for a foreign holiday after months of lockdown In other good news British tourists will be welcome in France from June 9 as long as they have proof of vaccination or a negative test The announcement by president Emmanuel Macron comes as a study finds much of Europe could safely be put on the travel green list this summer The list could include up to 24 countries The Times reports Mr Macron s announcement will pile further pressure on ministers to restart foreign holidays to major hotspots for sun starved Britons Under France s reopening restrictions on cafes and restaurants will be lifted gradually with a return to near normal by June 30 The Yale University research showed restarting quarantine free travel to popular destinations such as Spain Portugal and Greece would not increase infection rates And hospitalisations would only increase by about six a day if travel was restarted with up to 31 European countries There are currently around 124 daily hospitalisations in England Johan Lundgren boss of easyJet which commissioned the study said Based on the results of this ground breaking research and applying the principles set out in the roadmap set out by the Prime Minister easyJet can demonstrate that it is safe to put much of Europe on the green list This is because the analysis not only shows that travel from several European countries including popular holiday destinations like Spain Portugal and Greece would not affect the UK case rate But even more importantly that travel to and from Europe would have very little impact on hospitalisations in the UK He stressed that countries with worrying new variants should remain subject to strict measures such as quarantine The study is due to be submitted for peer review shortly Countries ratings as green amber and red will be set out by May 10\n",

      "Full FDA approval of Covid 19 vaccines could help fight vaccine hesitancy officials say CNN As a condition of the emergency use authorizations issued for the Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines those companies are expected to work toward asking the US Food and Drug Administration for full approval and some health officials are hoping it will happen soon Dr Sanjay Gupta looks into the origins of vaccine hesitancy Dr Fauci explains importance of vaccine approval process What medical professionals are doing to fight vaccine hesitancy These vaccines have been in use since mid December under emergency use authorizations known as EUAs During the pandemic real world data have shown the vaccines are against the coronavirus that causes Covid 19 Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told CNN s Jim Sciutto on Wednesday he hopes Covid 19 vaccines will receive full FDA approval very soon and that the FDA will work as expeditiously as possible on approval applications for coronavirus vaccines as they come in Progressing from authorized to approved would allow manufacturers to market and directly distribute their vaccines It could also have an impact on vaccine mandates and perhaps sway skeptics hesitant to get the vaccines now The road to FDA approval Currently the three Covid 19 vaccines distributed in the United States made by Pfizer BioNTech Moderna and Johnson Johnson are authorized but not approved Due to the seriousness of the pandemic vaccine makers originally applied for EUAs because the authorization process takes less time than what would be required for full approval Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests a medical product such as a vaccine that gets special FDA authorization to be used during an emergency When the health emergency is over then any EUA s issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect according to the FDA So vaccine makers will have to file a separate application for vaccines to be fully licensed CNN has contacted Pfizer BioNTech Moderna and Johnson Johnson the most recent Covid 19 vaccine to be authorized about their plans to apply for full approval of their vaccines None provided a timeline The typical approval process for vaccine developers requires completing lab research pre clinical testing and Phase 1 2 and 3 clinical trials in humans That has already been done for these coronavirus vaccines The FDA also requires vaccine manufacturers to submit data to support their manufacturing processes facilities product characterization and demonstration that the vaccine can be produced reliably and consistently Once all of that is complete both the clinical trials and manufacturing details companies can submit a Biologics License Application or BLA to the FDA By submitting a BLA to the FDA a company is seeking permission to distribute and market a vaccine for use in the United States according to the FDA s website FDA evaluates the data to determine whether the safety and ness of the vaccine has been demonstrated and whether the manufacturing and facility information assure product quality and consistency After its evaluation FDA decides whether to approve also known as to license the vaccine for use in the United States Applications designated as priority review mean the FDA s goal is to take action on an application within six months A standard review could take longer When you re getting a formal approval you have to have a certain amount of time just observing predominantly the safety and obviously the safety looks really really good in well over 140 million people having been vaccinated with at least a single dose Fauci said on CNN on Wednesday After all as spread of the virus is reduced the nation may no longer be under an emergency situation and the vaccines will need a different type of green light under the FDA The agency is the gold standard of a safety and regulatory organization throughout the world said Fauci chief medical adviser to President Biden I hope they do it quickly It will help show skeptics that the authorized Covid vaccines are safe A concern around authorized but unapproved vaccines hinges on vaccine hesitancy If history is any indication skepticism if not outright mistrust about an unapproved vaccine is nothing new One study published in 2009 months after the US declared a public health emergency due to the H1N1 influenza and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic researchers explored the public s willingness to use a drug or a vaccine with an EUA not full FDA approval by surveying a representative sample of more than 1 500 US adults The researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Georgia found that about 77 of respondents would be moderately very or extremely worried if offered an unapproved vaccine some 63 said they would not take it But the study also found that there were some other key factors that would convince respondents that a vaccine authorized under an EUA was safe to use If the vaccine were administered by a public health professional 55 of respondents said they would take it If it came with a fact sheet just over 57 of those surveyed said they would get it If their own health care provider administered the vaccine that number shot up to 68 Dr Jerome Adams US surgeon general during the Trump administration wrote in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post on Tuesday that approval will help show skeptics that the authorized coronavirus vaccines are safe We should also pursue full Food and Drug Administration approval and expand covid vaccinations to youths Adams wrote in part The individuals who got vaccinated early on were generally high risk and willing to take a vaccine authorized for emergency use But many people who are lower risk understandably ask if the benefits justify taking a medication that has not received the full and traditional FDA stamp of approval he wrote As vaccine manufacturers complete further studies which will eventually lead to expanded eligibility among minors it will help show skeptics that the authorized covid vaccines are safe Plans to require vaccines Some organizations say they expect to require the vaccine but have opted not to while it s authorized and not yet fully approved People when they hear it s still emergency use they still have a little concern about how far you can go with it Fauci said on CNN Wednesday The University of California and California State University systems announced last week that their universities intend to require faculty staff and students to be vaccinated against the coronavirus but the requirement would go into effect only once a vaccine has received full FDA approval The proposed policy would begin this fall The California State University noted in its announcement This requirement will become at the beginning of the fall 2021 term or upon full FDA approval of the vaccine whichever occurs later\n",

      "Financial pitfalls NRIs should avoid while investing in India First generation Indian migrants are far more likely to return to India annually to visit family friends or relatives attend family events or travel across the country During these short trips they have been known to squeeze in their financial appointments for India based investment decisions This hasty process usually leads to critical investment decisions being pushed aside or delegated to relatives or friends which ultimately leads to financial pitfalls In our experience with NRIs some of the usual pitfalls they are known to fall into and must consciously try to avoid are as follows Investing as a resident Once an individual attains the status of an NRI he must convert his existing bank accounts to an NRE NRO or FCNR accounts As an NRI you can open an NRO account that are rupee designated accounts and are repatriable Similarly investment instruments like MFs direct equity bonds and more have their restrictions For instance an NRIs DEMAT account will need to be converted to an NRO DEMAT account while stock trading activities will need to be routed through a PIS Portfolio Investment Scheme account The rules and regulations are ever changing keen NRI investors need to keep abreast with these changes to avoid falling into the trap of losses Barred Investments Often NRI s tend to continue with their residential status based investment instruments as well ignoring processes and regulations For instance as an NRI settled in the USA there are restrictions to which mutual fund houses you are allowed to invest through This is due to the stringent compliance requirement by the USA Canada s regulatory body FATCA To avoid the complexities in compliance only a handful of investing houses accept investments from NRIs residing in the US For NRI s in other nations continuing with the current MFs may require a simple status change update by submitting the necessary documentation Also Read Why NRIs should use the mutual fund route to investments The taxation web Tax avoidance or double taxation is another pitfall that most NRIs fail to account for Income earned in India which exceeds the specified amount in the form of interest dividends from equity shares or MFs rent capital gain etc become liable for tax filing In some countries income earned in India could be taxable both in India as well as in the country of the NRIs residence To circumvent this double taxation burden on NRIs a tax treaty better known as the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement DTAA is signed between India and multiple countries This treaty assists in tackling the problem of tax avoidance as well as determines the efficient method implied to tax an NRI income This avoids double taxation and offers relief by reducing the burden of taxes on income earned provided a DTAA provision exists between the two countries Beyond intent the foremost reason for NRIs to default on taxes is unawareness linked to the Indian tax laws that are constantly changing Zero diversification Tying your portfolio to a single asset class or even a single country s fate is a gamble NRIs often fail to diversify their investments across asset classes and invest in fixed returns assets like FD s or physical assets like gold and real estate The reason for this tunneled vision could be correlated to avoidance of the complicated web of regulations transactional compliances and taxation by NRIs Reports suggest NRI investments in Indian real estate are likely to grow at 12 in FY22 The average prices of properties in leading markets like NCR and Mumbai showed flat growth in the October December period of 2020 as compared to the previous year 2019 Falling interest rates too have caused traditional asset classes like FD s and more to lose their sheen There are multiple avenues for NRIs to choose from that are both risky as well as secured Mutual funds NPS direct equity PPF and more are avenues that can be considered based on the financial goals of the investor be it early retirement post retirement planning or simply securing their dependents future Digital Assets The latest fad of Non Fungible Tokens NFTs and Cryptocurrency along with its ambiguity over its legality by Indian laws are leaving investors in a tizzy Young NRIs that are tech savvy often tend to invest massive amounts of their corpus in such digital assets Owing to its volatility and legal repercussions especially in India it is best if investors maintain investing in such assets within their allocated limit ensuring that its uncertainty or volatility does not put

exposure in conjunction with an oversubscribed equity financing Trident completed its most significant transaction to date with the acquisition of a 60 interest in a gross revenue royalty GRR over the Thacker Pass Project Thacker Pass for a total consideration of US 28 0 million comprising US 26 0 million in cash and US 2 0 million in new ordinary shares in Trident Thacker Pass contains the largest defined lithium Mineral Reserve in the United States A successful concurrent equity financing of approximately GBP20 7 million approximately US 28 8 million was conducted at no discount to the prevailing market price to execute the Thacker Pass lithium royalty transaction and strengthen the balance sheet Trident completed the Talga gold royalties transaction and shortly post quarter end completed the previously announced Pukaqaqa copper royalties transaction finalising the acquisition of these seven royalties and With a portfolio inclusive of copper iron ore gold and now lithium Trident is increasingly reflective of the broader global mining sector providing investors with an inflation hedge in the face of loose global monetary policy and direct exposure to a once in a generation energy revolution Q1 royalty payments totalling approximately US 451 314 from royalties over producing assets an increase of 55 over Q4 2020 Royalty Stream Q1 2021 Payment Cumulative

area Trident notes the average grade at Koolyanobbing has fallen from 59 to 57 Fe since 2H20 Recent unprecedented strength in the iron ore market particularly for low grade fines products may incentivise operators to opportunistically favour production from lower grade areas in the short term 4 Trident s royalty covers a substantial portion of the Deception pit the highest grade deposit and a significant proportion of the total Koolyanobbing reserves Trident anticipates deferred production of this higher quality ore will benefit the Company in the short medium term Trident also notes the recent strategy overview presentation by Mineral Resources Limited the project operator which highlighted the impending finalisation of a 10 year plan for the Yilgarn Hub of which Koolyanobbing and its associated infrastructure is the central component Additionally Mineral Resources flagged the expansion of the Yilgarn Hub to 12Mtpa as a further growth opportunity and Commodity prices underlying Trident s royalty portfolio remained strong throughout Q1 2021 with iron ore averaging US 131 tonne copper averaging 8 503 tonne lithium carbonate equivalent LCE averaging US 9 083 tonne and gold averaging US 1 793 oz 5 Post quarter end copper has continued to climb to near 10 year highs while LCE prices have now doubled year to date to over US 13 500 tonne Q1 royalty portfolio growth combined with positive asset level progress by project operators Thacker Pass Lithium Project 6 In January 2021 Lithium Americas Corp LAC the project operator announced the receipt of the final key federal permit for the project followed shortly thereafter by a US 400 million equity fundraise primarily to fund the commencement of construction With the acquisition of 60 of the GRR Trident now has exposure to a key global lithium asset with a clear pathway to production Other highlights include Thacker Pass currently contains a CIM compliant Mineral Reserve of 3 1Mt LCE the largest lithium reserve in the United States with an anticipated mine life of 46 years based on reserves Thacker Pass is at an advanced stage of development with a highly attractive Pre Feasibility Study PFS announced on 21 June 2018 and a Definitive Feasibility Study due for completion in 2021 LAC has announced that key permits are in place with commencement of construction targeted for late 2021 or early 2022 and Trident expects Phase 1 production to start ramping up in 2024 The GRR is subject to a partial operator buy back which Trident expects will be exercised by LAC for proceeds to Trident of US 13 2 million during the first year of operation the Buyback Based on the PFS parameters published by LAC including an LCE price of 12 000 tonne Phase 1 steady state royalty revenue attributable to Trident is anticipated to be approximately US 3 8 million per annum increasing to US 7 6 million per annum at Phase 2 steady state assuming the Buy Back occurs before operations commence As anticipated the third party claimant has named Trident as a party to the existing litigation between Orion Resource Partners regarding the GRR The seller of the royalty has provided Trident with an indemnity subject to customary limitations and exclusions in respect of such proceedings Lake Rebecca Gold Project Apollo Consolidated Ltd Apollo the project operator has committed a material budget increase to advance the Lake Rebecca Gold Project 7 Lake Rebecca de risking the route to a future development decision Apollo has entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell its royalty interest over the Seguela Gold Project in Cote D Ivoire for A 20M cash It stated that the sale will add to existing cash reserves placing Apollo in a very strong position to take Rebecca forward Apollo announced the strategic acquisition of additional land tenure around Lake Rebecca to allow for full operational and planning flexibility as the company moves towards commercial studies 8 Apollo

outline of an optimised open pit shell for the proposed mine drilling has intersected wide zones of high grade gold mineralisation in two diamond drill holes located in the footwall of the Jennifer Structure 10 Apollo has stated the results from the two holes open potential for previously unknown structures to the east of the current resource with intersections up to 16m 4 12g t Au and 7 4m 4 70g t Au respectively Geotechnical drilling elsewhere on the project also intersected significant gold mineralisation Spring Hill Gold Project Trident notes the receipt of environmental approval for the Spring Hill Gold Project Spring Hill under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act EPBC The approval represents the achievement of a key milestone in the development of Spring Hill clearing the way for next steps toward development Pukaqaqa Copper Project Nexa Resources SA the project operator noted in its 2020 annual filing that the first part of pre feasibility metallurgical results for the Pukaqaqa Copper Project were concluded in December 2020 demonstrating better results than previous campaigns including improved recoveries and grades During 2021

works in the drilling area 11 Warrawoona Gold Project Calidus Resources Ltd Calidus the project operator is completing an integration study on its Blue Spec gold deposit to assess the economics of mining Blue Spec and trucking ore to the nearby Warrawoona plant potentially increasing the robustness of Warrawoona by increasing operating margins 12 In addition Caldius noted in its corporate presentation that Warrawoona will commence main construction this quarter as well as confirming that construction is fully funded and on schedule to pour first gold as planned in the first half of 2022 Mosquito Creek Gold Project Calidus has entered into a Farm In Agreement with Nimble Resources 13 the project operator which gives Calidus the right to earn up to 90 of the Mosquito Creek tenement E46 1035 located about 75km from its Warrawoona gold project and in the vicinity of the Blue Spec mining proposition E46 1035 is located along strike of two geochemical trends identified on tenements immediately to the west Calidus states that many soil and rock chip anomalies on the tenement have not been previously followed up with drilling and fieldwork will start in earnest this calendar year Koolyanobbing Iron Ore Project In its Q3 FY2021 quarterly results 14 Mineral Resources Limited stated that 2 5 million tonnes of iron ore were shipped from the Yilgarn Hub for the quarter Trident holds a 1 5 free on board royalty over the M77 1259 tenement which covers a substantial part of the Deception pit which forms part of the broader Koolyanobbing iron ore operation in Western Australia Mimbula Copper Project Production continues to ramp up at the Mimbula Copper Project and with the copper price recently touching near 10 year highs supported by solid fundamentals the project is well positioned to capitalise on continued positive market sentiment Strong balance sheet to support future acquisitions Unaudited cash balance of US 7 4 million as of 31 March 2021 not inclusive of Q1 royalty revenue which was received post quarter end This substantial cash balance coupled with ongoing projected revenues from two cash generative royalties and an ability to offer vendors publicly tradeable equity in Trident supports capacity for future acquisitions In addition Trident entered into a term sheet with Tribeca Global Resources Credit Pty Ltd during Q1 in respect of a proposed debt facility up to an amount of US 10 million The Facility is subject to the finalisation of definitive documents and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent Indicative of the strength of the pipeline Trident currently has 11 active NDAs under which it is reviewing a range of opportunities across commodities including mineral sands lead nickel copper gold zinc cobalt potash and iron ore and Trident continues to prioritise production or near production assets in order to materially build Trident s near term revenue profile Adam Davidson Chief Executive Officer of Trident commented The first quarter of 2021 was perhaps the most significant for Trident since its admission to trading on AIM less than a year ago with the 28 million acquisition of 60 of the Thacker Pass lithium royalty coupled with a substantial equity raise The fundraising was conducted at no discount to the prevailing share price was significantly oversubscribed and has resulted in a number of new institutional holders establishing a position in the Company In addition to funding our Thacker Pass transaction we have a very healthy balance sheet to support the continued growth and diversification of our royalty portfolio both through acquisition as well as positive asset level progress This bodes exceptionally well for Trident particularly against a global macro backdrop that is increasingly supportive of growing demand for critical commodities Within the last quarter we ve seen material positive updates at Lake Rebecca Spring Hill and the Western Australian Gold Royalty package tenements Revenue continues to remain volatile across Trident s two paying royalties a factor which underpins the opportunity available to Trident by which it can acquire single asset royalties at attractive valuations from natural sellers to ultimately construct a diversified portfolio of royalties with a more predictable payment profile Trident remains focused on executing value accretive transactions across the commodity and development space with a particular focus on enhancing near term revenue References 1 Inclusive of GST 2 Source Trident Royalties announcement dated 29

investors with exposure to a mix of base and precious metals bulk materials excluding thermal coal and battery metals Key highlights of Trident s strategy include Building a royalty and streaming portfolio to broadly mirror the commodity exposure of the global mining sector excluding thermal coal with a bias towards production or near production assets differentiating Trident from the majority of peers which are exclusively or heavily weighted to precious metals Acquiring royalties and streams in resource friendly jurisdictions worldwide while most competitors have portfolios focused on North and South America Targeting attractive small to mid size transactions which are often ignored in a sector dominated by large players Active deal sourcing which in addition to writing new royalties and streams will focus on the acquisition of assets held by natural sellers such as closed end funds prospect generators junior and mid tier miners holding royalties as non core assets and counterparties seeking to monetise packages of royalties and streams which are otherwise undervalued by the market Maintaining a low overhead model which is capable of supporting a larger scale business without a commensurate increase in operating costs and Leveraging the experience of management the board of directors and Trident s adviser team all of whom have deep industry connections and strong transactional experience across multiple commodities and jurisdictions The acquisition and aggregation of individual royalties and streams is expected to deliver strong returns for shareholders as assets are acquired on terms reflective of single asset risk compared with the lower risk profile of a diversified larger scale portfolio Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt Once scale has been achieved strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection growth and income Forward looking Statements This news release contains forward looking information The statements are based on reasonable assumptions and

      "First observation These words of the general secretary are not just to say one time and one place In the past few days General Secretary Xi Jinping visited Guangxi and gave important instructions on the construction of ecological civilization along the way Many golden sentences have been brushed off the screen At almost the same time the Central Ecological Environmental Protection Inspectorate in eight provinces and autonomous regions notified many typical cases of destroying the ecological environment It is thought provoking to link these two things together On the Lijiang River General Secretary Xi Jinping listened to a report on the comprehensive management of the river basin In recent years Guilin City has vigorously promoted the Lijiang River to quot control chaos water mountains and root causes quot to improve the ecological environment of the Lijiang River Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Hongshe general secretary emphasized The worst thing is quarrying If you destroy a mountain you will lose such a mountain forever The whole of China and the world is such a treasure Don t destroy it Central Ecological Environment Among the typical cases just exposed by the protection inspection team there are several cases of illegal quarrying and mining In some places illegal quarrying is still carried out in the World Geopark Reserve which has caused serious ecological damage This time the general secretary pointed out the quarrying problem straightforwardly which is very realistic for some places Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China whether it is for domestic investigations and investigations or attending international events wherever General Secretary Xi Jinping goes he has talked about the concept that green waters and green mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains However some phenomena that seriously damage the ecology and seriously pollute the environment are still exposed from time to time What is the problem behind this Some local leading cadres believe that the region has a good ecological background large environmental capacity a little sewage a little tree cut and a little project quot innocent quot and they lack understanding of the urgency of ecological environmental protection The concept of quot emphasizing development and neglecting protection quot of some local leading cadres has not been fundamentally reversed and the phenomenon that ecological environmental protection is quot important when it comes to it but secondary when it is done quot still occurs from time to time There are also historical reasons that some local leading cadres quot should the pot quot and the ability and level of governance to implement the new development concept still needs to be improved quot Any abuse of mining and digging requires not only accountability but also criminal responsibility in accordance with the law quot Regarding the chaos of quarrying the general secretary 39 s words were very serious and once again sounded the alarm for the ecological and environmental protection of various places In fact this is also the consistent attitude of the Party Central Committee towards ecological and environmental issues The illegal construction of villas in Qinling Mountains destroys the ecological environment General Secretary Xi Jinping has issued important instructions 6 times to solve the problems personally local ecological damage in the Qilian Mountains pollution incident in the Tengger Desert illegal filling of the Qiandao Lake Grasp the problem of destruction to the end There is a phenomenon that is particularly noteworthy In the past few days the Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspection Team has exposed many typical cases of blindly expanding production capacity and launching projects regardless of resource endowments Shanxi Jinzhong City has not approved the first construction and launched five large scale coking projects in violation of regulations Enterprises illegally discharged pollutants and competed with the people for water causing difficulties for nearby residents The construction of chemical and coal power projects in Guzhen County Anhui illegally started construction and the bottom line of regional environmental quality has been repeatedly breached posing a threat to the water ecological environment of the Huaihe River In the first year of the Fourth Five Year Plan after experiencing the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and facing the external environment of headwinds and currents the enthusiasm for development projects in some places began to swell and they wanted to pursue a quot good start quot The Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Supervisor is approved by the Party Central Committee At the beginning of the quot 14th Five Year Plan quot this inspection was organized and the strict control of high energy consuming and high emission projects was blindly launched as one of the inspection priorities which was very targeted Coincidentally 5 years ago the quot 13th Five Year Plan quot started Before that in 2015 China 39 s economic growth continued to slow down falling below 7 Some provinces and cities along the Yangtze River are gearing up for projects in the 13th Five Year Plan On January 5 2016 General Secretary Xi Jinping convened a symposium on promoting the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in Chongqing and he eloquently proposed to protect together and not to develop quot It seems to be a pot of cold water quot This symposium promptly cooled the development impulse of the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River and it was a reversal of the direction of economic development In the past five years the General Secretary hosted three symposiums around the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt to consolidate the path of ecological priority and green development Practice has proved that the joint efforts to protect the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River not only did not affect the development speed of the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River but also greatly enhanced the supporting and leading role of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in supporting the high quality development of the country Looking at the first year in five years getting started is critical The quot 14th Five Year Plan quot is a critical period and window period for carbon peaks Once the two highs project blindly launched it will not only damage the current ecological environment but also pose a severe challenge to the future carbon dioxide emission reduction and the achievement of carbon peak and carbon neutral commitments It is very necessary to press down on such signs from the beginning Combining this background and looking at the words of the General Secretary during this Guangxi inspection we can bring out more profound meaning quot adhere to the correct ecological concept and development concept quot quot maintain the authenticity and integrity of the landscape ecology as an important quot Work quot quot Incorporate carbon peaking and carbon neutrality into the overall layout of economic and social development and ecological civilization construction quot quot Promote a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development quot quot Come on a path of high quality development that conforms to local realities quot This It was spoken to Guangxi and it was spoken to the whole country A good start a good start The alarm bells must be ringing forever in all places and the trend of destroying the ecological environment in exchange for economic development at a time insisting on ecological priority and promoting high quality development can create a high quality and happy life

      "VELCAN HOLDINGS Annual results 2020 stable financial results but decrease of the net income t PRESS RELEASE Luxembourg 30 th April 2021 ANNUAL RESULTS 20 20 STABLE FINANCIAL RESULTS BUT DECREASE OF THE NET INCOME DUE TO DISAPPOINTING OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL AND INDIA NON AUDITED KEY CONSOLIDATED FIGURES 20 20 201 9 Var Revenues EUR m 2 5 2 8 12 EBITDA EUR m 2 0 1 4 4 5 Net Income EUR m 2 1 3 6 4 1 Shareholders Equity EUR m 1 16 1 21 4 Cash and Financial assets 10 5 103 1 closed 2020 with a net result Group share of EUR 2 1m compared to EUR 3 6m in 2019 This decline essentially stems from on one hand a drop of the Brazilian operational result due to a very low generation coupled with a massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency and on the other hand an increase of the impairment of the Indian projects leading to an overall decline of the result The EBITDA is also down by 45 EUR 2 0m in 2020 vs EUR 1 4 m in 2019 Net financial gains which amounted to EUR 7 7m were almost stable compared to EUR 8 1m in 2019 mostly because of the reallocation of the portfolio from corporate bonds to equity and commodities Shareholder s equity decreased by 4 mainly due to the share buyback programs executed in 2020 492 k shares bought back in 2020 for a total price of EUR 3 1m During 2020 the continued developing its hydropower concessions located in India 571 MW and operated its Rodeio Bonito hydropower plant 15 MW in Brazil The uncertainties and deadlocks of the Indian hydropower market remained as in 2019 and prevented progress of the projects leading to an additional provision or Eur 2 8 million 20 for FY 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 considering the previously booked provisions This additional provision was already accounted for in the 2020 half yearly results published in October 2020 The Rodeio Bonito plant generation was historically low 40 below the 2019 generation as a result of the severe draught in the south of Brazil which led to an increase of the payments to the MRE system 1 At constant foreign exchange rates the turnover has grown 18 thanks to the inflation of selling prices In Euro the turnover is down by 12 EUR 2 5 m in 2020 vs EUR 2 8 m in 2019 because of the massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency in 2020 41 FINANCIAL YEAR 20 20 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE BUSINESS India The hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the State of Arunachal Pradesh could not make significant progress due to several long lasting administrative and regulatory impediments aggravated by the Covid 19 pandemic The Techno Economic Clearance TEC Environmental Clearance Forest Clearance as well as most of the post TEC investigations being complete for the tandem Heo Tato 1 426 MW the main next development steps for these 2 projects are the land acquisition the transport infrastructure the amendment of the concession agreements the stage 2 Forest Clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable Power Purchase Agreement PPA These steps however essentially fall under the purview and responsibility of the State and Central Governments During 2020 the land acquisition procedure conducted by the State Government was halted due to a stoppage of the land survey by several land owners who physically prevented the District administration to enter some parts of the land complaining about land ownership disputes and claiming immediate financial compensations The discussions initiated between the state government and the concerned owners in February 2020 were suspended due to the Covid 19 outbreak as the required meetings could happen only physically The procedure could restart only in February 2021 All the on site surveys and boundary markings were completed by the in March 2021 without interruption As of the date of this press release the Group has not received the official survey report and list of land owners from the However the Group s team attended each survey and it is the Group understanding that significant parts of the land requirement have again been registered by the as being under ownership dispute and that the survey may lead to an increase of disputed areas as compared to earlier lists established by the State Government The Group does not know yet if and how the Government of Arunachal Pradesh GoAP will settle these disputes and find a solution that will allow permanent site access and the Projects implementation considers that as per the current concession agreement and applicable regulations the land acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the exclusive responsibility of the licensing Government The concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer Negotiations with the GoAP for the amendment of the concession agreement relate to the development timeframe but also to the amendment of the allocated capacities still 380MW in the current concession agreement and other important terms have not progressed since 2018 This has led to the impossibility to renew the TECs of the Heo and Tato 1 426 MW tandem in 2020 as such renewal required either a concession agreement up to date with the 426 MW capacity approved by CEA or a non objection certificate NOC from the GoAP TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP granted in 2015 for 3 years and already extended a first time in 2018 for 2 years were bearing validities until on 27 th July 2020 and 28 th October 2020 respectively Applications for renewals of both TECs were submitted to CEA which requested the Group to obtain from GoAP a NOC acknowledging that the GoAP has no objection to the renewal of the projects TECs for the current capacities of 240 MW and 186 MW After several discussions the GoAP refused on 1 st October 2020 to issue a NOC unless the concession agreements were amended under conditions entailing significant financial costs some of which the Group does not agree with After requesting a draft amendment to the GoAP during Q4 2020 without success the Group finally sent its own proposed draft amendment in Q1 2021 Its main provisions relate to the allocated installed capacities the administrative fees the development timeframe the obligations of both parties and the increase of the free power to the GoAP against the withdrawal of its potential equity participation in the projects The provisions have been proposed by the Group considering the historical difficulties and the ground reality of the projects and of the Indian hydropower market As of the date of this press release the discussions are going on with the GoAP but both TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP are technically not valid anymore and their renewal is depending on the execution of the revised concession agreement in addition to the CEA renewal procedure The road infrastructures have kept progressing at a slow pace during 2020 as they did in previous years No progress has been made by the regarding the acceleration of the overall completion schedule The scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade up to the projects site are still scheduled theoretically in 2022 but will most likely face significant delays of 2 to 3 years given that for some stretches the technical studies have not yet even been completed On the forest clearance side the renewal of the stage I clearance has been applied for in September 2020 and is still under progress as of date The Group continued to explore the Indian market and to conduct its preliminary search for a PPA during 2020 All the major Indian power traders PPA brokers and distribution companies DISCOMS contacted for Heo and Tato 1 either declined to take up a commercial discussion for a PPA or did not respond The continued lack of appetite of the market for hydropower PPAs results from the commercial and financial Indian market conditions which remained the same during 2020 and still do not fulfil the requirements for the long term and bankable sale of hydropower The market remained constrained by the lack of appropriate regulatory framework for such bankable PPAs the stressed financial position of electricity distribution companies DISCOMS and the indirect competition of cheap solar and wind power Grid stability and the requirement for peak power 2 have also become a growing issue for Run of the River ROR hence with no storage hydro projects such as Heo and Tato 1 HEPs Two years after the announcement of the new hydropower policy by the a first part of the long awaited implementation regulation has finally be issued imposing a Hydropower Purchase Obligation HPO on DISCOMS setting a percentage of power that shall be procured by them from hydropower sources between 2021 and 2030 These percentages range from 0 18 to 2 82 and are remarkably lower than those of solar power currently at 10 25 for 2021 The question is raised within the industry whether these provisions will be sufficient to trigger a general revival of the hydropower sector and enough demand for long term bankable PPAs for projects which are not yet under construction Despite the above issues the Group s projects are the only hydropower projects of such size in India owned and developed by a foreign investor They are amongst the most advanced private projects and present competitive techno economic and environmental features Despite long term promising prospects the current Indian power market and especially the hydropower sector are still characterized by a lot of uncertainties The Groups projects have been heavily delayed several years in a row These delays and uncertainties have been reflected in an additional provision of Eur 2 8 million 20 of gross value decided for first semester 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 of gross value considering the cumulated provisions booked in previous years EUR 4 4m or 30 of gross value The Indian projects activities have been detailed in chapter I 4 1 of the annual report available at Brazil The Rodeio Bonito Hydropower plant 15 MW recorded a historically low production of 29 496 MWh in 2020 40 below the 2019 generation 49 113 MWh in 2019 and close to its all time record low of 2012 24 793 MWh However the turnover when expressed in the Brazilian currency BRL was up thanks to the inflation and the MRE system But as a result of this very low electricity generation and the national low hydro generation in 2020 the plant had to compensate the MRE system which was in a negative position This is why payments to the MRE were much higher reaching EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 As a result the EBITDA of the plant amounted to BRL 8 1m against BRL 9 3m in 2019 down by 13 When converted in euro the EBITDA of the plant was significantly lower to EUR 1 4m vs 2 1m in 2019 51 mostly due to a 34 depreciation of the average rate of the Brazilian Real vs Euro currency in 2020 Financial Assets also continued to manage actively its treasury throughout a complicated year marked by the Covid 19 pandemic and its impact on the financial markets The Group executed an important reallocation of its investments in other asset classes The Group started the year with a portfolio invested at approximately 60 in bonds mostly high yield corporate ones This bond portfolio was reduced by approximately half in January and February as the rewards seemed not any more commensurate with the potential default risks Since the March 2020 market crunch the Group has gradually changed its asset allocation to include more exposure to equity and commodities mostly gold As of 31 st December 2020 the bonds exposure including T bills was reduced to 19 of the portfolio 64 as of 31 12 19 whereas the rest of the portfolio of cash financial assets and financial liabilities EUR 104 5 m included a negative net cash position of EUR 9 3 m 9 of the portfolio versus a positive net debt position of EUR 27 2 m in 2019 25 of the portfolio 19 of gold related exposure versus 1 as of 31 12 2019 21 of oil related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 4 of silver related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 42 of equity excluding oil long positions 7 as of 31 12 2019 4 of equity short positions 2 in 2019 1 in private equity and credit 3 in 2019 While reallocating its financial assets towards equity the Group has invested in companies which were trading at historically low prices and could benefit from the improvement of the Covid 19 situation The two sectors hence selected were banking and energy This strategy of reallocation of the financial assets proved profitable as the Group net financial assets rose from Eur 103 million to Eur 105 million and the financial result amounted to EUR 7 7 m as of 31 12 2020 stable when compared to 2019 EUR 8 1 m and despite the COVID 19 crisis Given the current very low levels of benchmark rates in all developed markets USA Europe and Japan the Group does not anticipate it will increase again its investments in corporate bonds in the medium term The Group has reduced significantly its financial exposure to the USD and increased its exposure to the Euro and the Japanese Yen As of 31 12 2020 the Group financial assets were exposed notably to the US Dollars 35 against 67 in 2019 the Japanese Yen 25 against 2 in 2019 and the Euro 22 against 9 in 2019 It is to be noted that the Gold and Silver positions are priced in USD and as such are included in the former USD exposure Contrary to the previous years the Group has fully invested its cash and has used some leverage see above net cash position The financial portfolio is detailed in part I section 3 1 B of the annual report 2020 available at During the year continued to execute buyback programs in order to provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to sell their shares The shares are bought back in view of their cancellation or to cover for new grants of free shares A total of 492 348 shares were bought back in 2020 for a total price of Eur 3 131 696 275 000 shares were cancelled in April 2020 and as of 31 st December 2020 held 314 023 own shares representing 5 66 of its share capital Foreseeable evolution of the Group After the closing of this financial year the Group is pursuing the following main objectives as a priority for FY 2021 Pursuing the development of the Indian hydropower projects On the short term executing the required amendment to the concession agreements of the Indian hydropower projects in order to secure the renewal of the TECs and the renewal of Forest clearances Continue the active management of its diversified financial investments The ability of the Group to pursue these objectives is subject to the evolution of the current Covid 19 crisis which may affect both the development of the Indian projects and the financial portfolio FINANCIAL YEAR 2020 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Statement unaudited consolidated Turnover amounted to EUR 2 5m against EUR 2 8m in 2018 a 12 decrease mainly from electricity sales in Brazil The turnover in local currency increased by 18 with the inflation on electricity sale prices However the depreciation of the Brazilian currency vs the Euro currency was responsible for a 34 decrease of the turnover in Euro The current operating result amounted to EUR 5 6m against 4 3m in 2019 Payments to the MRE Energy Reallocation Mechanism were EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 Depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets of Rodeio Bonito plant amounted to EUR 0 5m EUR 0 7m in 2019 while depreciation on

Group employed on average 20 permanent employees in 2020 External expenses are totaling EUR 1 4m in 2020 vs EUR 1 5m in 2019 Net Financial Gain for the group amounted to EUR 7 7m in 2020 mostly because of the reallocation strategy from bonds to equity and commodities markets and despite the USD depreciation 9 compared to end of 2019 and its impact on the Group s cash and financial assets position The impact of this depreciation has been managed by the currency reallocation strategy of the Group avoiding bigger potential forex losses see breakdown per currency in chapter I 7 4 of the annual report This gain of 7 7m compares to EUR 8 1m in 2019 In 2020 other operating income EUR 0 2m consisted mainly of earn out gains on Brazilian assets related to Brazilian assets divested in previous years This figure was NIL in 2019 Income tax expense amounted to EUR 0 2m in 2020 same as in 2019 The net result Group share was EUR 2 1m in 2020 FY compared to EUR 3 6m in 2019 The Group s EBITDA reached EUR 2 0m compared to EUR 1 4m in 2019 The strong depreciation of BRL 41 and INR Indian Currency 12 closing rates when compared to Euro at 2020 closing date has heavily and negatively impacted the other comprehensive income as the Group s main tangible and intangible investments have been done in local currency EUR 4 5m in 2020 against EUR 0 1m in 2019 The total comprehensive income amounts to a loss of EUR 2 4m in 2020 against a gain of EUR 3 5m in 2019 Balance sheet Assets unaudited consolidated Net intangible assets stands at 8 3m in 2020 and are down by EUR 3 7m versus

costs on Indian projects Net tangible assets stands at 5 3m in 2020 and decreased by EUR 2 7m between 2019 and 2020 mainly because of depreciation of the Rodeio Bonito plant EUR 0 5m and the depreciation of the Brazilian currency EUR 2 3m Cash cash equivalent assets and financial assets net of Current financial liabilities have increased from EUR 103m in 2019 to EUR 105m in 2020 1 mainly thanks the good performance of the Group s financial portfolio and despite the share buyback programs Financial assets consist mainly in listed equity bonds and commodities related stocks Finally total assets increased by 15 3 during 2020 FY up by EUR 18 9 m mostly because of the bank overdraft facility described in below as part of the liabilities and the related asset purchases At 31 st December 2020 the Group and its subsidiaries holds 314 023 own shares 2019 146 810 At year end closing price of EUR 6 41 those own shares have a market value of EUR 2 0m Balance sheet Liabilities

plants previously owned by the Group Satyamaharshi SMPCL 7 5 MW and Rithwik RPPL 7 5 MW owned between 2006 and 2010 The existing provision represents the major part of the claims as well as accumulated interests and judicial expenses Trade and other payables amount to EUR 0 9 m vs EUR 0 5m in 2019 due to EUR 0 3 m of payable related to MRE payments in Brazil due in early 2021 but related to 2020 generation Current financial liabilities of EUR 23 9 m in 2020 vs NIL in 2019 are related to overdraft facilities granted by a brokerage firm to the Group to leverage its listed investments trading activities Under this facility securities held in the trading account are used as a security to borrow money This facility has enabled the Group to leverage its investments and maximize its profits But it is to be noted that leverage works both ways and could also cause higher losses in case of fall in market prices Own shares booked directly against the equity of the Group at their historical cost reduce the net shareholder s equity of the Group by EUR 2 1m at 31 st December 2020 versus EUR 1 2m at 31 st December 2019 following the share buyback programs EUR 3 1m the capital

      "Super Soco s CPx super scooter Going electric for a germ free commute Sales of electric motorcycles are big news for the bike industry latest figures show that March registrations in this sector this year are up by 151 per cent over the same month in 2020 while nearly half of all new low powered scooters are now battery powered Could it be because commuters post Covid are fearful of rubbing shoulders with strangers on public transport because it s easier to filter past caused by the spread of emergency LTNs or because they re fun relatively inexpensive to run and friendly It s probably a mix of all three but to find what all the fuss is about I jumped on one of the latest new machines the CPx super scooter from Super Soco who claim it s similar in performance to a 125cc two wheeler Attractively styled the CPx comes either with one battery offering a claimed range of 44 miles or two offering a claimed range of 87 miles The price difference between the two is significant with the single battery model costing 3 599 after taking the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles grant into consideration and the dual battery model costing 4 699 demonstrating just how pricey battery technology still is The CPx comes in black grey or silver and is backed by a two year warranty for the vehicle three for the battery It can be ridden on an A1 licence requiring training after which if you pass the various test levels you will be entitled to carry a pillion and ride on the motorway although I wouldn t recommend that on the CPx with its limited top speed The Super Soco is reasonably well equipped with a smart clear LCD display reasonably good build quality a big comfy thought slightly too high squashy seat a tall clear protective screen very decent rear view mirrors a useful parcel rack a side stand as well as centre stand and even a reverse mode useful perhaps for getting out of tight front garden parking spaces It is of course eerily quiet once you turn the key and all it requires to get moving there s no clutch or gears is a twist of the throttle which sees the bike spring to life and surge forward thanks to its 4 8Kw 5hp hub mounted electric motor In London traffic it kept up nicely with other vehicles from a standing start in fact its forte is leaping smartly away from traffic lights Acceleration is reasonably swift and progressive at least when the batteries are well charged during our brief assessment they didn t drop below 80 per cent right up to the claimed top speed of around 55mph The brakes both operated by hand controls as with a bicycle worked firmly and effectively and the steering was sufficiently quick to make filtering around other traffic very efficient indeed It also felt grippy on the road in bends despite having fairly narrow tyres although we didn t ride it in the wet Compared to the more basic model launched by Super Soco and reviewed here in 2017 the CPx is far more advanced Thanks to the 16 inch front wheel the CPx felt stable and well able to cope with lumps and bumps in the road at least at the front end At the rear where there s a smaller 14 inch rear wheel the CPx s ability to soak up bumps was more limited you need to slow down for sharper edged ramps to avoid a jolt through the seat The CPx was very easy to push into and out of parking spaces important in London stable when parked on its side stand and easy to hoist onto its equally stable centre stand Despite its rakish looks there s not much in the way of luxury it s a scooter after all but there s a small hidey hole large enough for a phone though I wouldn t advise it it might bounce out in the leg shields next to a hook useful perhaps for carrying take aways or small shopping bags There s also a USB socket for charging purposes a built in alarm decent sized pillion foot pegs and an ignition operated steering lock The batteries live under the hinged seat and can be charged from a standard household plug in situ or easily detached and carried indoors to be plugged in They are heavy mind at nearly 20kgs each You wouldn t want to carry them far Likes The CPx is a cinch to ride very quiet and unless you count the fumes going up the electric power station chimney very clean It s also stable and vicious speed bumps aside comfy Dislikes The otherwise effective screen felt perilously close to my face I d prefer it to have been angled further away for safety The seat is high and broad on account of the size of the batteries so will put shorter riders off I would also have preferred more built in stowage but there really isn t room If it was mine I d invest in a small top box fitted to the rack So who s going to buy it You could find a new petrol powered scooter for less but that of course would cause more pollution and wouldn t give you the same electric environmental feel good factor while through London It will appeal to those who like the easy unintimidating approachable nature of an electric scooter and to those for whom environmental issues are paramount Crucially it is also according to figures supplied by Super Soco considerably cheaper to run than a petrol model It s worth noting however that according to motorcycle bible MCN which conducted extensive tests performance on the CPx can drop off as the batteries charge level goes down They also said they were able to achieve an 80 mile range with two batteries but only by remaining under 30mph no problem in London Super Soco s own sums show that an average 125cc petrol scooter costs 5p per mile to run compared to just 1p for the CPx Over a year for a typical 23 mile round commute over 256 working days a year that amounts to a cost of 294 40 for a petrol scooter or a winning 58 88 for the CPx There s the added convenience of not having to stop at petrol stations Charging the batteries instead they say takes 3 4 hours and can be done at home or the office A petrol scooter costs 25 a year to tax while the keeper of an electric scooter pays nothing Maintenance is also far less of an issue for electric bikes as there are fewer moving parts If the CPx s battery should ever need replacing outside warranty however it s hardly cheap at over 1 800 So there you have it a clean quiet guilt free new tech solution to commuting around London post Covid while avoiding all those potentially germy commuters on the bus and tube More

      "Great Green Wall promises better lives to African farmers By Richard Wetaya Once complete it will reportedly be the largest living structure on the planet covering an area 8 000 km long by 17 km wide three times the size of the Great Barrier Reef and stretching across the entire continent With the fresh infusion of funds obtained at the Paris One Planet Summit for Biodiversity it is anticipated that hard pressed pastoral and agricultural communities long challenged by poverty and persistent food insecurity in the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions will enjoy better lives Diarra Fatoumata a 38 year old mother of four is from one of those farming communities Koremairwa village in the Doutchi District of southwestern Niger She is one of many smallholder farmers who recently received improved millet and maize seeds courtesy of the initiative My farming prospects have gotten better on account of using improved grain seeds she said recently She elaborated Previously some of the seeds I used to plant would germinate but the crops would wither and die off With the new seeds I am now able to produce and harvest sturdier crops which have a better market value Together with other smallholder farmers from my village and other areas of the Sahel we have also attained training on appropriate crop rotation and how to use small scale irrigation for crop production and for extending farming activities into the dry season For good measure a number of smallholder farmers in Sudan Eritrea Ethiopia and Djibouti were also trained in proper agroforestry water harvesting and irrigation practices and on how to create shelterbelts for their farmlands Shelterbelts are now helping many farmers in controlling soil erosion in Sudan said Abdel Aldai a wheat and maize farmer in Karima Sudan He added With agroforestry we were taught how to integrate trees which are helpful in climate change mitigation into our farming activities with an aim of achieving better productivity by tapping into the ecosystem amenities supplied by trees Agricultural and environment policy analysts reckon that the additional funding vouchsafed by the French government the African Development Bank the World Bank the European Commission and other sources will breathe new life into the initiative The initiative has just under a decade to achieve its goals of creating 10 million green jobs sequestering 250 million tonnes of carbon restoring 100 million hectares of degraded land and protecting Africa s biodiversity while reducing poverty and food insecurity Its mediocre progress to date was highlighted in a United Nations status report Great Green Wall Implementation Status and Way Ahead to 2030 released last year The report found that the though the initiative was more than halfway to its 2030 completion date it had only covered 4 per cent of its target area The findings did make for good reading in some African ecological and environmental research think tank circles For some it was an indictment on the people in charge of the initiative said Faustin Banjoko a climate action and development policy expert He added It also lent credence to schools of thought that held that zero net degradation and dryland tree planting afforestation in the 7 million square kilometers Sahel region would face long odds as had been the case with the North African Green Dam project By all accounts however the initiative s execution shortfalls were due to deficiencies in funding and technical support Now those obstacles seem to be out of the way Godfrey Oluka an environment specialist at the United Nations Development Programme said the new funding in a year that marks the beginning of the UN s Decade for Ecosystem Restoration may just be the silver lining the initiative needed It is a welcome development It will hopefully draw forth a renewed urgency in executing the initiative s targets that is the restoration of degraded land in the Sahel a region that experiences a 3 per cent decline in agricultural production per year due to land degradation The region has in the last 30 years been devastated by severe drought and massive loss of fertile land due to climate change and over farming and the enhancement of agricultural production systems in the rest of the Great Green Wall GGW intervention zones represented by Ethiopia Eritrea Mauritania and Djibouti Oluka said Banjoko elaborated On the face of it there is a lot of progress being made in the GGW nations especially in the areas of promoting agroforestry improving livestock breeding providing green jobs creating shelter belts for farmlands improving irrigation efficiency for agricultural production strengthening climate resilience and boosting pastoral and agro pastoral regenerative agricultural production These will in the course of time all translate into better incomes and a better food security status quo Because crop production in the Sahel is for the most part rain fed with limited irrigated agriculture several smallholding traditional agriculture farmers in countries like Niger Burkina Faso and Mali have been getting apprenticeships on the improved use of sprinkle and drip surface irrigation techniques and on proper rainwater harvesting practices There was further good news for farmers when the Green Climate Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development recently announced that they had a pipeline investment project called the Great Green Wall Umbrella Programme GGW Up It would ostensibly boost climate finance for the GGW nation s rural populations and would ensure that small scale farmers and agribusinesses have better access to markets and strengthened value chains creating economic opportunities and jobs through the development of climate resilient infrastructure and expanding the use of solar energy Speaking at the One Planet Summit Susan Gardner director of the UN s Environment Programme s Ecosystems Division said the initiative was an inspiring example of ecosystem restoration in action This initiative alone will not transform the Sahel s fortunes overnight but will rapidly become a green growth corridor that will bring investment boost food security create jobs and sow the seeds of peace she noted In recent years however there have been growing concerns that the ongoing conflict in central Sahel would slow down progress particularly in Mali Burkina Faso and Niger There are already grim realities on the ground with statistics from the International Organisation for Migration s Displacement Tracking Matrix indicating that over 1 5 million people have been internally displaced by the ongoing crises in the three nations Notwithstanding that there are pointers to strides being made During a recent International Forest Day Forward Thinkers Webinar Louise Baker managing director of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification Global Mechanism said about 20 per cent of the project s target area has now been completed All partners are working assiduously towards the initiative s 2030 targets she said adding Eighteen million hectares of the proposed 100 million land hectares have been restored 350 000 green jobs out of the proposed 10 million have been created and about US 90 million generated by communities in the initiative s intervention zone On the green economy front the anticipation is that by the initiative s completion point 8 000 kilometers of the intervention zone s land area will be covered with a mosaic of trees and plants Thus far more than 5 million hectares of degraded land have been restored in Niger and 12 million trees planted in Senegal Some 15 million land hectares have been restored in Ethiopia 29 602 hectares in Burkina Faso 52 930 hectares in Eritrea and 120 hectares of land in Mali among other places According to the UN report land restoration in the project intervention zones positively impacted 15 of the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals SDGs By all accounts the US 90 million generated helped to reduce rural poverty in the intervention zones Baker is upbeat about the initiative s prospects This initiative will not come up short like previous tree planting ecological projects on the continent The difference is that it is owned and implemented by communities and countries themselves she said She added Each country has designated a protected area dedicated to activities along the Great Green Wall managed by their local communities A unique practice known as rainwater harvesting which collects the heavy annual rainfall and distributes it through irrigation systems is one of the ways in which the Great Green Wall is sustained Sustainability of this programme is already being owned by the communities\n",

      "Shi Jinyuan Gold and Silver Soaring and Falling Markets and Latest Price Trend Operation Suggestions Market trend analysis April 30 gold news analysis Thursday 4 29 gold technical today 39 s gold market is after the Asian market rushed higher and the entire European market fell so the current market day is considered to belong Weak but from the perspective of the trend yesterday 39 s price broke the high point of the rebound before the last decline in 1785 and there are signs of strengthening on the trend But the key support is the 1762 position If this position falls below then the whole trend will reverse and become a very weak movement However regardless of the trend in the case of intraday weakening because the US is a rebound before the market then the US The probability of a second dip after the market is relatively high If the US market drops twice and breaks the current low then it is a continuation of the short position Today 39 s US market operation is to consider rebounding and shorting The current pressure on the top of gold is 1779 1781 1783 which are 382 0 5 618 after the intraday high of 1798 fell and the high point of rebound after the first fall below 1780 in the European market is near 1782 And the support below is the 1766 position which is the starting point for the ascent of the 4 hour chart level yesterday and the low point of 1762 yesterday Gold today 39 s suggestion is to go short in the 1781 83 area stop loss at 1788 and target at 1773 Gold is currently uncertain whether the market trend is long or short After all after yesterday s rise today s retracement is greater If the retracement of this wave is lower than 1762 the next time it rises again then the market is on the high side Rising the next time if it breaks the high point of 1789 today then the 1800 will be at risk of breaking and if today s price retracement falls below the position of 1762 or after today s decline tomorrow will extend its downward trend to break the situation of 1762 then This is the reversal of the entire trend After falling below 1762 the decline may be very large in the 1730 1720 area This is the general expectation On the whole today 39 s gold short term operation ideas suggest that the callback is mainly long and the rebound short is supplemented The top focus is on the first line resistance of 1780 1785 and the short term below focuses on the first line support of 1740 1745\n",

      "What s your role in AngloGold Ashanti Sam Jonah questioned After his public address to Rotary Club in Accra Sam Kwesi Esson Jonah KBE has come under immense criticism from persons close to the government who feel that portions of his address attacked the Executive The latest criticism is coming from Paul Adom Otchere host of Good Evening Ghana GEG who in his biweekly show on Metro TV tried to punch holes in the senior stateman s speech According to him Sam Jonah KBE must have had a role in Ashanti Gold which later turned into AngloGold Ashanti therefore he should be able to tell the young people of Ghana the role he played while working with the company On his show Thursday April 29 2021 Adom Otchere stated that if Sam Jonah KBE wants to talk about the future of Ghana then he must first of all open up about his past Sam Jonah cannot come and talk about the future without answering questions about his past it behoves him to make statements about his past If he won t say anything at all at least we know his role with Adisadel College and AshGold Football Club we do not know his role in that major transaction that has punctuated the corporate and political history of our society the Ashanti transaction Paul Adom Otchere said on his show monitored by GhanaWeb He indicated that there are two Ashanti transactions one was failed by the government of Ghana which left a lot of rancour s between JJ Rawlings and Sam Jonah and their relationship broke off completely We don t know the details Sam Jonah must come and tell us And then the transaction was rehashed and relaunched in 2001 and 2002 this time it was supported by the JA Kufuor government and it was successful In both transactions there was a critical decision about the heritage of the Ghanaian young person because this gold resource which is a Ghanaian resource was being treated in a certain way was it being treated in the right way to guarantee the future of the young people that today Sam Jonah is concerned about Was it being treated in a certain way that eventually guaranteed our future Was there an option with Randgold resources and other people who wanted to participate that could have been better for the future of Ghana he asked Adom Otchere stressed that Sam Jonah KBE must answer these questions He Sam Jonah is a big man he has been around for a very long time and he comes and says the youth of Ghana I now feel the responsibility to speak and you don t tell us what you ve been doing in the past when you have had such a tenacious relationship with the political decision making of Ghana since 1983 you won t tell us what has happened about that Paul Adom Otchere argues that Sam Jonah s answer to the question will help the Ghanaian youth understand whether or not he has found a new philosophy or a new idea So that we can understand whether the idea you present today is the idea that has been with you for a very long time If that idea that you present today is not an idea that has been with for a long time it is still a welcome idea but we want to know so that we put it on record because the record is important he stressed\n",
