What s your role in AngloGold Ashanti Sam Jonah questioned After his public address to Rotary Club in Accra Sam Kwesi Esson Jonah KBE has come under immense criticism from persons close to the government who feel that portions of his address attacked the Executive The latest criticism is coming from Paul Adom Otchere host of Good Evening Ghana GEG who in his biweekly show on Metro TV tried to punch holes in the senior stateman s speech According to him Sam Jonah KBE must have had a role in Ashanti Gold which later turned into AngloGold Ashanti therefore he should be able to tell the young people of Ghana the role he played while working with the company On his show Thursday April 29 2021 Adom Otchere stated that if Sam Jonah KBE wants to talk about the future of Ghana then he must first of all open up about his past Sam Jonah cannot come and talk about the future without answering questions about his past it behoves him to make statements about his past If he won t say anything at all at least we know his role with Adisadel College and AshGold Football Club we do not know his role in that major transaction that has punctuated the corporate and political history of our society the Ashanti transaction Paul Adom Otchere said on his show monitored by GhanaWeb He indicated that there are two Ashanti transactions one was failed by the government of Ghana which left a lot of rancour s between JJ Rawlings and Sam Jonah and their relationship broke off completely We don t know the details Sam Jonah must come and tell us And then the transaction was rehashed and relaunched in 2001 and 2002 this time it was supported by the JA Kufuor government and it was successful In both transactions there was a critical decision about the heritage of the Ghanaian young person because this gold resource which is a Ghanaian resource was being treated in a certain way was it being treated in the right way to guarantee the future of the young people that today Sam Jonah is concerned about Was it being treated in a certain way that eventually guaranteed our future Was there an option with Randgold resources and other people who wanted to participate that could have been better for the future of Ghana he asked Adom Otchere stressed that Sam Jonah KBE must answer these questions He Sam Jonah is a big man he has been around for a very long time and he comes and says the youth of Ghana I now feel the responsibility to speak and you don t tell us what you ve been doing in the past when you have had such a tenacious relationship with the political decision making of Ghana since 1983 you won t tell us what has happened about that Paul Adom Otchere argues that Sam Jonah s answer to the question will help the Ghanaian youth understand whether or not he has found a new philosophy or a new idea So that we can understand whether the idea you present today is the idea that has been with you for a very long time If that idea that you present today is not an idea that has been with for a long time it is still a welcome idea but we want to know so that we put it on record because the record is important he stressed

steady centering on public works on which the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic had a small impact Nevertheless sales declined from the previous fiscal year as adversely affected by slack private sector construction as well as limited sales and service activities in the first six month period Americas In North America sales dropped from the previous fiscal year While demand for construction equipment was on a recovery track in the housing sector and the rental industry it was adversely affected by sluggish economic conditions under the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic and that for construction and

domestic manufacturers increased demand remained steady supported by the government s economic stimulus measures such as infrastructure investment after containing the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic

coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic As a result sales increased from the previous fiscal year Asia and Oceania In Asia demand showed steady recovery centering on construction equipment in Indonesia Thailand and Malaysia and some signs of recovery for mining equipment emerged in coal mines in Indonesia in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of recovering coal prices However sales dropped sharply from the previous fiscal year as particularly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic in the first six month period In Oceania sales increased supported by steady demand for mining equipment in iron

remained slack in Saudi Arabia largely affected by sluggish crude oil prices and the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic In Africa demand for construction equipment remained slack in Southern Africa mainly affected by the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic While some signs of recovery of demand surfaced in other regions sales declined as affected by reduced sales of mining equipment as well Retail Finance

previous fiscal year to JPY 66 3 billion as affected by a drop in new contracts in the nine month period Segment profit fell by 16 6 to JPY 10 5 billion mainly reflecting the adverse effects of an extension of payments and revaluation of vehicles after lease use Industrial Machinery and Others For the fiscal year under review sales fell by 3 6 from the previous fiscal year to JPY 171 2 billion This was mainly affected by slack capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses sheet metal machines and machine tools as well as their delayed installation at customers overseas workplaces especially under the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic Meanwhile segment profit increased by 19 3 to JPY 16 3 billion as sales remained steady for Excimer laser related business in the semiconductor market Projections for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31 2022 From April 1 2021 to March 31 2022 In the construction mining and utility equipment business Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase as it believes that demand will continue to recover from the fiscal year under review returning to the level prior to the coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic By region Komatsu

sales season occurred twice Nevertheless Komatsu projects that global demand will increase from the fiscal year under review Furthermore Komatsu projects that demand for mining equipment will remain steady in iron ore copper and gold mines while it will enter a recovery track in coal mines With respect to profits Komatsu expects that they will advance reflecting an increase in volume of sales differences in composition of sales and improved selling prices In the retail finance business Komatsu anticipates both sales and segment profit will improve mainly due to an increase in new contracts

3 common mistakes investors make with penny stocks The Motley Fool UK In for a penny in for a pound Penny stocks can seem appealing The idea that an investment that costs a matter of pence could generate pounds of rewards can be beguiling But there are a lot of simple mistakes investors make choosing penny stocks Here are three I ve observed Focus on price not value Here s a thought experiment Let s say my children could travel to school in the cheapest bus the school can buy or the most expensive Which would I prefer The answer seems obvious For most people quality is worth paying for Yet penny stocks can focus our attention on price not value The legendary investor Warren Buffett said that price is what you pay value is what you get A penny stock could indeed turn out to be good value But to assess what the underlying value is I d look not just at the price I dd also consider the company s future ability to generate profits and create shareholder value Penny stocks and balance sheets One common mistake investors make is buying on share price alone without looking at the company s balance sheet Imagine buying a second hand car for 100 That might sound like a bargain But if it needs to have an MOT the following week that identifies 3 000 of necessary repairs even the 100 price tag could seem like a bad bargain in retrospect It s the same when a company has a lot of debt or other future financial obligations that dwarf its financial resources How will it pay them Will it have a rights issue and dilute shareholders as a penny stock like Hammerson did last year Balance sheets scare many people But they aren t as technical as they may sound Before investing in any penny stocks I d always spend at least a few minutes looking at a company s recent balance sheets Seeing what a company s debt profile looks like is a crucial indicator of its financial health in my view Single asset focus A lot of penny stocks are exclusively or mainly focused on a single asset I find that s particularly true with early stage resource stocks For example Bacanora Lithium is pinning a lot of hope on one project in Mexico Sometimes such a focus is positive and a lack of diversification can amplify rewards If a company owns one mining licence and literally strikes gold its return on capital could be huge But the reverse is true as well if a company is over concentrated in one asset the lack of diversification can disproportionately damage it Single asset focus improves potential reward only by increasing potential risk in many cases That matters because as Warren Buffett reminds us Rule number one never lose money Rule number two never forget rule number one That can be hard to do But by learning from common mistakes other investors make I hope I can improve my likely returns when identifying penny stocks to consider for my portfolio

Hammersmith Bridge Bridge of sighs and a shameful collective catalogue of failure Clemmie Watkins used to have a 10 minute walk to school across Since September it has become a 40 minute bike ride via on roads plagued by speeding drivers and riverside paths that flood when the Thames rises On winter nights even adults avoid her unlit route home across Dukes Meadows a haunt of muggers and doggers On Wednesday the 13 year old slipped and fell crossing a wet Barnes bridge cutting herself and ruining her school skirt It s really annoying she said If it floods it s so much longer in the rain It s not good by Hammersmith and Fulham council when cracks were detected in its pedestals The crossing was kept open to pedestrians and cyclists until August last year but the cracks widened Since then the effect on has been catastrophic About 4 000 vehicles a day divert via her Putney constituency Even at 7am the already polluted approaches to Putney bridge the nearest alternative crossing are gridlocked The inability to reopen the bridge has made London a laughing stock Politicians blame each other while residents despair Ms Anderson describes it as an international embarrassment It has even made the New York Times On September 9 last year Transport Secretary accompanied by Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey visited the bridge In a video Mr Shapps vowed to take control and get it fixed and reopened Yesterday it met for the 15th time The taskforce includes representatives from Transport for London and Heidi Alexander Sadiq Khan s deputy mayor for transport But Mr Khan said this week that the taskforce had been little more than a talking shop to kick the can down the road Clemmie s mother Julia Watkins a member of the Hammersmith Bridge SOS residents group agrees You can t walk over a taskforce she said They have done nothing They were meant to be knocking heads together Baroness Vere points the finger at Hammersmith and Fulham council The council points the finger at Grant Shapps A resident survey found some feeling suicidal because of the closure Almost nine in 10 said they had suffered worse mental health The apolitical Hammersmith Society in a letter to the Prime Minister said The communities on both sides of the river are unified in their anger their disappointment and their despair There is a growing acknowledgement that only the Government has the financial might to break the deadlock The council owns the bridge but cannot afford the 141 million restoration bill Mr Shapps wants the council to pay half the bill has provided about 20 million for investigations and design work including 4 million for a temporary ferry and repairs from a government Covid bail out last year The Government should be able to break this deadlock Ms Watkins said They could have straightaway funded a temporary pedestrian and cycling bridge Instead they went for this ludicrous ferry It s completely inadequate Even the ferry has been delayed An initial plan was to have it start operating last autumn Uber Boat by Thames Clippers has won the contract but two temporary piers have yet to be constructed Residents fear services may not start until November Our contract is to have it running by the beginning of October but we are in negotiations with TfL to accelerate that said a spokesman for Beckett Rankine which will design the piers TfL would like it ready at the start of September but there are a lot of things that have to go right Normally it would take a year to build a new pier The contract between TfL and Thames Clippers is for a minimum of 12 months to a maximum of five years Adults will be charged 1 55 per crossing though children will travel free There will be two ferries with a third as back up The crossing will take 90 seconds with a boat every five to seven minutes in peak hours It will be a huge improvement for the residents the Beckett Rankine spokesman said It will be a very slick service Thames Clippers know what they are doing The source added It s a lot cheaper than a temporary bridge The council s preferred option is a double decker bridge Designed by architects Foster Partners and specialist bridge engineers COWI it would cost about 100 million 41 million less than fully restoring the existing bridge This could allow the bridge to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists in summer next year and to drivers two months later four years earlier than otherwise planned But motorists would face an estimated 3 toll The other hope for a quick win rests with engineers who have analysed the structural integrity of the pedestals It may be the case that the ironwork has stabilised and the bridge could be safe to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists The engineers report was submitted to the DfT three weeks ago But sources say that further engineering analysis and checks need to be completed and this could take a further three months Behind the scenes there is concern about safety The Government wants the council to retain liability should anything go wrong Residents are furious at the thought that a risk averse culture could be used as an excuse to keep the bridge closed On that basis politicians should close every bridge in the country one said noting that teenagers continue to climb the railings to cross the bridge at night and use it as a skateboard park If they continue to do that after the engineers report shows it s safe that is just despicable They re ruining people s lives The key date is when the clocks go back in October when the thousands a day who follow Clemmie s route risk being stranded on the wrong side of the river Michelle Coulter another member of Hammersmith Bridge SOS whose daughters Iris 16 and Lana 13 also attend school in Hammersmith said children were often unable to board the replacement buses Under Covid rules the single deckers can only carry 14 passengers Since August it s become so stressful I cannot tell you she said My youngest finishes school at 4pm In winter she was getting home at 5 30pm sometimes 6pm That was by bus Mr Khan accuses the Government of dither and delay and failing to honour promises made before the 2019 General Election The council submitted its double decker bridge proposal in February but it is regarded by the DfT to be lacking detail Two weeks ago minister Rachel Maclean accused the council of wearing gold tinted lenses and said a blank cheque would not be forthcoming The DfT said it could not comment due to pre election purdah restrictions Sadiq Khan Lab Keen to have the bridge reopened to pedestrians and cyclists if engineers find the structure safe but says the bridge will only fully reopen to vehicles when the Government covers the bulk of the cost A TfL funded ferry service is due to start in the autumn Shaun Bailey Con Promises to make the ferry free build a temporary road bridge and fully repair the existing bridge which he would rename the Prince Philip bridge Says it is essential the bridge can carry vehicles and would not impose a toll on motorists Says TfL should have funded the full repairs as soon as the bridge closed in 2019 He would fund his ideas by establishing a TfL investment fund Sian Berry Green Believes the Department for Transport should provide at least the majority of the costs of repairing the bridge and wants a date to be set for the reopening of the bridge for walking and cycling Luisa Porritt Lib Dem The Government is the only body with the funds to foot the bill The mayor could make a bigger contribution if the 2 billion Silvertown Tunnel road project was axed

Advertorial in the Australian from Anzac Day cheers Gold aiming to strike a balance in gold explorationDGO Gold is hoping it has created a strategic investment model that will reinvigorate gold exploration in Australia Picture BloombergDAMON KITNEYVICTORIAN BUSINESS EDITOR6 42PM APRIL 25 2021Melbourne investment banker Bruce Parncutt calls his latest plaything a gold discovery company Neither an explorer nor a miner the ASX listed DGO Gold of which Mr Parncutt has been an executive director for the past year is looking to carve out a unique niche in the Australian gold sector Its game plan is to make strategic equity investments in West Australian brownfield gold discoveries bankroll themwith additional capital and combine them with its own pursuit of largely ignored exploration opportunities Mr Parncutt said he hopes DGO has created a model that can reinvigorate gold exploration in Australia Gold is our fourth largest export so the industry is pretty important for the nation We do the mining part well but I m not so sure we do the exploration part well Especially the brownfields guys who need to get their resource to some scale he said Most junior explorers find a piece of ground and they raise the capital and explore We think we are adding intelligent value to that process DGO is also a unique human story combining the skills of a career investment banker and former boss of McIntosh Securities in Mr Parncutt with the exploration expertise of one of the resource sector s most famed geologists Ed Eshuys As Joseph Gutnick s exploration director in the late 1980s and early 1990s Mr Eshuys led the teams that discovered the Plutonic Bronzewing and Jundee gold deposits and the Cawse nickel deposit Before those triumphs Mr Eshuys also had involvement in the Maggie Hays and Mariners nickel discoveries in the 1970s He is now DGO Gold s executive chairman and is working closely with Mr Parncutt who has been on the board since 2018 and DGO s management team to develop two sizeable WA gold resources and to explore for more We do bring together a unique set of skills It is all very well to have the money but to apply that you need the technical skills Mr Eshuys said Bruce and I do debate between ourselves our respective points of view and invariably come up with a consensus That has led us to a disciplined approach to take DGO from where it was to where it is now DGO Gold directors Ed Eshuys and Bruce Parncutt DGO Gold initially evaluated 100 gold explorers and their projects Ten ASX juniors made the shortlist before DGO narrowed it down to two taking strategic stakes in booming Pilbara gold explorer De Grey Mining and Leonora gold explorer NTM Gold DGO has a string of major greenfield exploration projects of its own being drilled including on prime South Australian ground owned by junior explorer Investigator Resources as the first stage to earning an 80 per cent stake in the latter s Pernatty copper project DGO also has a 40 per cent interest in Yilgarn Exploration Ventures which is drilling in the Leonora district of Western Australia One of the critical things we found when we were talking to all the juniors was that they didn t understand the need to have at least 3 million ounces to have something of meaningful scale Mr Eshuys said Part of our discussions with these companies was about raising sufficient funds to do the job properly That is where De Grey came to the party They did understand they needed to raise more money and they did that The strategy has seen DGO Gold shares soar from just 17c four years ago and 1 70 last year when Mr Parncutt became an executive to close on Friday at 3 63 They soared over 4 in September last year on the back of the coronavirus fuelled surge in the gold price which saw it spike to US2056 per ounce last August While gold prices have trended lower since the start of 2021 amid rising US Treasury yields and an increasingly positive outlook for the global economic recovery the DGO share price has held up DGO now owns 16 per cent of De Grey which is drilling out a significant Pilbara gold discovery It also has board representation and has supported De Grey s capital raisings including a 25m round last September De Grey is in a unique position in terms of its Pilbara land position That is one of our key elements when we invest and explore Mr Eshuys said Following the merger late last year of NTM Gold with Dacian Gold DGO will now emerge with a 10 per cent stake in Dacian Of the 25m raised last September 8m was also pegged for greenfield exploration The value of DGO s stake in De Grey covers its 225m market capitalisation meaning the market is currently attributing no value to DGO s substantial exploration interests DGO has attracted some big name investors including stockbroking veteran Tom Klinger one of Christopher Skase s biggest backers through the 1980s and another former McIntosh managing director Others are former stockbroking resources turned private equity fund adviser Peter Woodford the rich lister Costa family member Robert Costa and Regal Funds Management

einen Anstieg von 3 gegen ber dem vorangegangenen M rz Quartal und einen R ckgang von 16 gegen ber dem Vorquartal darstellt Der Anstieg der Produktion im Vergleich zum ersten Quartal 2020 spiegelt die st rkere Leistung von Haile wider die teilweise durch die geringere Produktion der neuseel ndischen Betriebe ausgeglichen wurde Die geringere Produktion im Quartalsvergleich ist in erster Linie auf Neuseeland zur ckzuf hren wo eine M hlenst rung Macraes beeintr chtigte und Waihi wie geplant eine reduzierte Verarbeitungskampagne durchf hrte Haile war ebenfalls r ckl ufig wobei ein h herer durchschnittlicher Einsatzgrad durch einen geringeren M hlendurchsatz ausgeglichen wurde Didipio blieb in einem Zustand der Betriebsbereitschaft Die steigenden konsolidierten Cash Kosten in H he von 800 pro Unze und die All in Sustaining Costs AISC in H he von 1 229 pro verkaufter Unze spiegeln die geringere Produktion und die im Vergleich zum Vorquartal h heren kapitalisierten Vorabstriche wider insbesondere bei Macraes Das Unternehmen verzeichnete im ersten Quartal einen Goldabsatz von 82 847 Unzen was einem R ckgang von 14 gegen ber dem vierten Quartal 2020 entspricht In Haile produzierte der Betrieb im ersten Quartal 44 341 Unzen Gold 51 mehr als im vorangegangenen M rz Quartal was auf eine verbesserte Produktivit t beim Abbau zur ckzuf hren ist Die Goldproduktion und der M hlendurchsatz waren im ersten Quartal um 10 bzw 20 niedriger als im Vorquartal was auf Probleme mit dem Fluss des ges ttigten saprolitischen Erzes zur Anlage die im Laufe des Quartals angegangen und behoben wurden und einen geplanten dreit gigen Anlagenstillstand zur ckzuf hren ist Gleichzeitig stiegen die gesamten Bergbaubewegungen um 24 bzw 7 gegen ber dem vorangegangenen M rz Quartal bzw dem vierten Quartal 2020 und der Betrieb erreichte im Quartal einen Rekord an Gesamtbewegungen Der Anstieg der Kosten f r den Abbau und das Mahlen bei Haile im ersten Quartal spiegelt den geringeren Anlagendurchsatz die Auswirkungen von einmaligen Kosten im Zusammenhang mit der Abschw chung von Anlagenst rungen durch ges ttigtes Erz und in geringerem Ma e den zus tzlichen Personalbestand zur Bew ltigung der COVID 19 bedingten Abwesenheit der Belegschaft wider Die best tigten COVID 19 F lle am Standort stiegen von 63 am Ende des Jahres 2020 auf 111 im ersten Quartal Das Unternehmen geht weiterhin davon aus dass Haile 150 000 bis 170 0000 Unzen Gold bei AISC des Standorts von 950 bis 1 100 pro verkaufter Unze produzieren wird und weist darauf hin dass der Ausblick durch zus tzliche Herausforderungen im Zusammenhang mit der COVID 19 Pandemie beeintr chtigt werden k nnte In Neuseeland produzierte Waihi im ersten Quartal 4 337 Unzen Gold Die Aktivit ten bei Waihi konzentrierten sich in erster Linie auf die Erschlie ung von Martha Underground einschlie lich der Fertigstellung von 2 311 Metern Untertageerschlie ung im ersten Quartal Dar ber hinaus meldete das Unternehmen in Verbindung mit der abgeschlossenen Machbarkeitsstudie die erste Reserve von 620 000 Unzen Gold bei Martha Underground MUG Die Erschlie ung von MUG verl uft nach Plan sodass die kontinuierliche Produktion im Juni nach dem Austausch der bestehenden SAG M hle von Waihi beginnen wird Die Prognose f r das Gesamtjahr 2021 bei Waihi bleibt unver ndert Die Produktion von Macraes ging im Quartalsvergleich um 19 und im Vergleich zum vorangegangenen Quartal im M rz um 12 zur ck was in erster Linie auf eine einmalige Unterbrechung des M hlenbetriebs aufgrund eines Ausfalls des M hlenmotors Anfang Februar zur ckzuf hren ist Dar ber hinaus erforderten au ergew hnlich starke Regenf lle im Januar eine zweiw chige Evakuierung von Frasers Underground und verhinderten vor bergehend den Zugang zum Erzabbau in den Tagebauen daher wurden die Abbauanstrengungen auf einen verst rkten Abbau von Abraum und Vorabbau im Tagebau Deepdell North gerichtet Die h heren AISC im ersten Quartal spiegeln den geringeren M hlendurchsatz und die erh hten Investitionen in den Unterhalt und die Vorabbauaktivit ten wider Die Gesamtjahresprognose f r Macraes bleibt unver ndert Das Unternehmen geht davon aus dass der M hlenmotor im zweiten Quartal ersetzt wird w hrend gleichzeitig der Autoklav planm ig neu gemauert wird Didipio befindet sich weiterhin im Zustand der Betriebsbereitschaft Im ersten Quartal gab es keine Produktion da der Betrieb aufgrund der anhaltenden Blockade der Zufahrtsstra e eingestellt wurde Das Unternehmen verbuchte 4 5 Mio an Holdingkosten als Teil der konsolidierten Corporate General and Administration die sich auf die Aufrechterhaltung von Didipio im Zustand der Betriebsbereitschaft beziehen Dies steht im Vergleich zu 9 1 Mio im vorherigen Quartal Das Financial or Technical Assistance Agreement FTAA muss derzeit noch vom philippinischen Department of Environment and Natural Resources DENR an das Office of the President r ckbest tigt werden Das Unternehmen ist nicht in der Lage einen konkreten Zeitplan f r den Abschluss der Erneuerung zu nennen Die Ausbreitung und das effektive Management von COVID 19 auf den Philippinen kann ein Faktor f r den Zeitplan f r die Wiederaufnahme des normalen Betriebs sein der bis zu 12 Monate dauern k nnte Seit M rz 2020 wurden in Didipio neun positive COVID 19 F lle verwaltet von denen vier im ersten Quartal 2021 auftraten Finanzen In den drei Monaten die am 31 M rz 2021 endeten erwirtschaftete das Unternehmen einen Umsatz von 148 9 Mio und ein bereinigtes EBITDA von 66 5 Mio was 11 bzw 6 unter dem des Vorquartals liegt was auf geringere Goldverk ufe aus Neuseeland zur ckzuf hren ist Im ersten Quartal stiegen der Umsatz und das bereinigte EBITDA um 8 bzw 34 gegen ber dem vorangegangenen M rz Quartal was auf eine verbesserte Leistung von Haile und einen um 18 h heren durchschnittlichen Goldpreis in diesem Zeitraum zur ckzuf hren ist Der bereinigte Nettogewinn ohne Didipio Buchhaltungskosten betrug im ersten Quartal 21 8 Mio oder 0 03 pro Aktie und profitierte von der Verbesserung des durchschnittlichen Goldpreises gegen ber dem Vorjahresquartal Der operative Cashflow lag im ersten Quartal bei 47 6 Mio ein Anstieg im Vergleich zum Vorquartal der auf den st rkeren Goldpreis und niedrigere Buchhaltungskosten f r Didipio zur ckzuf hren ist Dies wurde teilweise durch Bewegungen des Betriebskapitals aufgrund einer Erh hung der Lagerbest nde bei Haile ausgeglichen Der voll verw sserte Cashflow pro Aktie vor Working Capital Bewegungen betrug 0 09 pro Aktie Der Investitions Cashflow in H he von 71 9 Mio im ersten Quartal erh hte sich im Vergleich zum Vorquartal aufgrund h herer Investitionsausgaben bei Haile f r die Erweiterung des Abfalllagers und der Vorabstreifungsaktivit ten bei Macraes sowie der laufenden Investitionen in die Erschlie ung des Martha Undergrounds bei Waihi Zum 31 M rz 2021 belief sich der Bargeldbestand des Unternehmens auf 145

EU accuses Apple of breaking antitrust law over music streaming London CNN Business European regulators have accused Apple Galloway to oxygenate economy break up Big Tech Margrethe Vestager the European Commission s top antitrust official said Friday that the bloc had reached the preliminary conclusion that Apple is in breach of competition law The company s music service competes with streaming services but Apple charges high commission fees on rivals in the App store and forbids them to inform of alternative subscription options she said in a post on Twitter Consumers losing out she added The European Commission launched an investigation of Apple last June following a complaint from music and podcast giant ify The Commission said in a statement Friday that it takes issue with the mandatory use of Apple s in app purchase system imposed on streaming services It said it is also concerned that Apple applies certain restrictions on app developers preventing them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities By setting strict rules on the App store that disadvantage competing music streaming services Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition Vestager said in the statement ify CEO Daniel Ek praised the Commission saying in a Twitter post that fairness is the key to competition We are one step closer to creating a level playing field which is so important for the entire ecosystem of European developers he added The accusations are the latest development in a series of high profile battles between the European Union and Big Tech companies that have resulted in hefty penalties Apple could eventually be fined up to 10 of its annual sales if found in violation of competition rules Apple said in a statement on Friday that the Commission s argument on ify s behalf is the opposite of fair competition At the core of this case is ify s demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app a practice that no store in the world allows Once again they want all the benefits of the App Store but don t think they should have to pay anything for that it added Margrethe Vestager speaks during a press conference on artificial intelligence in April 2021 Europe has turned itself into the cop on the Big Tech beat repeatedly enforcing its rules and hitting the industry s top American companies with huge fines The European Union last year unveiled formal antitrust charges against Amazon AMZN for abusing its dominance in online shopping Google GOOGL has also been hit with a series of antitrust investigations and penalties Last year Apple won an appeal against a landmark 2016 ruling from the European Commission that it owed Ireland 13 billion 14 9 billion in taxes The European Union s second highest court ruled that the Commission had not proven that the company had received illegal state aid from Ireland through favorable tax agreements Vestager has appealed the decision Hadas Gold contributed to this article

Re Bitcoin or Gold If you are talking about a long term investment 20 years 30 years with less risk GOLD is the best choice but if you wanted to earn more and with also have an absolute risk it gonna be Bitcoin Well I don t think that people would able to wait for 20 years just to see their portfolio will grow Because as what I observe in these new generation almost all of them are in the hurry I don t know why but they are impatient But for me I have to choice both of them for a better assurance it was just like putting an eggs to 2 baskets

Gold Forecast Hovering Between Moving Averages Pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds because if it is a slow and gradual rise then I believe that gold should do fairly well Gold markets initially tried to rally during the course of the trading session on Thursday but failed to continue going higher at the 200 day EMA as it continues to be quite resistive At this point the market then felt to reach down below the 50 day EMA which of course was a very negative sign However by the end of the session we turned around to break above the 50 day EMA and now it looks like the market is essentially doing the same thing it has been doing for several days These are two major averages that a lot of people pay attention to so it should not be overly surprising that we are stuck in this general vicinity Furthermore you have to pay close attention to the US dollar because the gold market is highly influenced by it Now that that we have broken down below the 50 day EMA it looks like the market is finding value hunters underneath just above the 1750 level I think what we are looking at here is a market that is trying to figure out where we are getting ready to go longer term When you look at the charts you can see that we have formed a double bottom just below the 1700 level so I think if we break down below the 1750 level then we will go testing that area However the 1750 level above had been resisted previously broken out above and now has been retested At this point we have to question whether or not this attempt to form a basing pattern has started to stick A break above the 1800 level opens up the possibility of a much bigger move and therefore I think that is the key for buying this market Until then I would be hesitant to put a lot of money into the gold market but it certainly looks as if we are trying to turn things around It could be very noisy over the next couple of weeks but I do have my eye on this market as a confirmation of the return could very well send this market looking towards the highs again Pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds because if it is a slow and gradual rise then I believe that gold should do fairly well

Gold standard swab tests will cost holidaymakers just 45 each Holidaymakers will be able to get a Covid test for just 45 under government plans to make holidays abroad more affordable when international travel opens up The PCR tests which are required on entry by most European countries would be provided for a fraction of the current price if the government s plan goes ahead the transport secretary said Gold standard PCR swab tests will continue to be required for all travellers arriving in Britain despite the Prime Minister previously suggesting that rapid lateral flow tests could be considered for use The news of cheaper tests for holidaymakers comes three weeks after Boris Johnson asked officials to consider using the on the spot rapid tests to make the tests more affordable stating that the reopening the holiday market from May 17 was a priority Grant Shapps the transport secretary announced the news on Thursday that a new entrant had made it possible to supply PCR tests for 44 40 Currently anyone coming to the UK has to take a pre flight test and buy a two swab package to be used two and eight days after arrival Official packages use gold standard PCR technology and cost around 200 a head this is due to fall to 45 by May 17 when some international travel is set to resume Shapps told the Commons I know that the House is interested on the update with regard to travel returning internationally and I wanted to provide a very quick update to say that although PCR tests may be required from a medical scientific point of view we have been working with private laboratories pharmacies supermarkets and other companies to encourage them to deliver on their logistical expertise and enter the market and drive down the cost We ve seen some success so far because the cost of a single PCR day two test now has come down to 60 from one of the large providers on the government linked site with a new entrant now at 44 90 enabling more people to access PCR tests as international travel returns The drop in price brings hope to the millions of Britons desperate for a foreign holiday after months of lockdown In other good news British tourists will be welcome in France from June 9 as long as they have proof of vaccination or a negative test The announcement by president Emmanuel Macron comes as a study finds much of Europe could safely be put on the travel green list this summer The list could include up to 24 countries The Times reports Mr Macron s announcement will pile further pressure on ministers to restart foreign holidays to major hotspots for sun starved Britons Under France s reopening restrictions on cafes and restaurants will be lifted gradually with a return to near normal by June 30 The Yale University research showed restarting quarantine free travel to popular destinations such as Spain Portugal and Greece would not increase infection rates And hospitalisations would only increase by about six a day if travel was restarted with up to 31 European countries There are currently around 124 daily hospitalisations in England Johan Lundgren boss of easyJet which commissioned the study said Based on the results of this ground breaking research and applying the principles set out in the roadmap set out by the Prime Minister easyJet can demonstrate that it is safe to put much of Europe on the green list This is because the analysis not only shows that travel from several European countries including popular holiday destinations like Spain Portugal and Greece would not affect the UK case rate But even more importantly that travel to and from Europe would have very little impact on hospitalisations in the UK He stressed that countries with worrying new variants should remain subject to strict measures such as quarantine The study is due to be submitted for peer review shortly Countries ratings as green amber and red will be set out by May 10

Westminster redecorating could paint Johnson into a corner The writer a former head of the Downing Street policy unit is a Harvard senior fellowBritish politics currently resembles a whodunnit with Westminster consumed by one question who paid to redecorate the prime minister s Downing Street flat Boris Johnson will not be brought down by wallpaper gate voters didn t foot the bill and are looking forward to the summer thanks to his swift vaccine rollout But if the impression keeps growing that Britain is run by a gilded chumocracy it could prove toxic at the next election It may seem odd that a domestic makeover has achieved such prominence It s partly because it is the latest in a series of allegations including that ministers offered Covid contracts to friends and helped a Tory donor win a lucrative planning permission In the early stages of the pandemic it was understandable that urgency sometimes trumped due diligence but there is now a feeling that too many affairs of state are being treated with casual informality The Electoral Commission seems to believe that the prime minister may have broken the law Although Johnson insists he has settled the 58 000 bill for the flat he has not denied that it was originally paid for by the Conservative party through a loan or donation neither of which were declared The dramatic cast of characters makes it impossible to kill the story The poisonous Rasputin Dominic Cummings ousted as chief of staff is preparing a dossier of wounding information for a parliamentary committee Ben Elliot the Duchess of Cornwall s nephew was party co chairman when a gift of 15 000 to the party from businessman Lord Brownlow was declared to the Electoral Commission a second gift of 58 000 was not Meanwhile the first fianc e Carrie Symonds whose choice of gold wallpaper supposedly sent the prime minister into paroxysms has been dubbed Carrie Antoinette The most damaging aspect may prove to be not the cover up but the snub to a national treasure the John Lewis department store Tatler magazine quoted unnamed friends of Symonds complaining that Johnson s predecessor Theresa May had created a John Lewis furniture nightmare The commissioning of eco designer Lulu Lytle whose colourful prints fill grand houses from Barbados to Park Avenue feels like an extravagance which is especially jarring given Symonds supposed environmentalism Lytle may lace her curtains with seaweed but there s nothing eco about chucking out a two year old sofa The taxpayer will not be footing the bill unlike the grants given to Johnson s girlfriend Jennifer Arcuri when he was mayor of London or the huge sums spent on test and trace The problem is that it seems to cast the prime minister in a new light as a man who cares about appearances rather than the messy haired rogue we thought we knew Central to Boris Johnson s charm is that he has always looked a shambles lived off pizza ridden rickety bikes enjoyed a good boogie on the dance floor and not given a damn He has always worried about money but mainly to support his children from official and unofficial dalliances His mistakes and lack of pretension have made him human in an age of robotic politicians To diss John Lewis however is to attack an institution which has served Middle England from cradle to grave Many of us got our school uniforms there we had our wedding lists there and we still buy presents for granny there knowing she can always return them with no fuss Its genius is to be faintly upmarket but not flashy as voters might once have seen Boris British prime ministers are unusual in having to live above the shop in pretty modest circumstances Most opt for the four bedroom flat above Number 11 Downing Street and let their chancellor use the smaller one above Number 10 When you work in the building you get used to bumping into the country s leaders on the back stairs and seeing their children playing in the garden The Elys e Palace or the White House it ain t I used to take my turn with the policemen for the only shower room but it supports our belief that we are a sober nation of principle At Chequers the prime minister s country house I was once told approvingly by staff that Gordon Brown was so parsimonious that he had refused to light the log fires There is actually a strong argument for the state to do more to maintain these official buildings But it was cack handed to have tried to create a Downing Street Trust to fund improvements which might in turn have saved Johnson from having to cough up Next week s local elections will show whether the public has noticed any of this I suspect they won t Johnson has a strong poll lead and a large majority The risk is that the drip drip of sleaze allegations will slowly corrode this government just as it doomed John Major s in the 1990s when a minister was jailed for perjury and some MPs took cash for questions It felt then as though the Tories had been in power too long Could cash for curtains create a similar ennui John Lewis s legendary slogan is never knowingly undersold I would add never knowingly underestimate Boris Johnson But if he doesn t come clean and if this wasn t the only loan this may prove to have been the moment he painted himself into a corner

Full FDA approval of Covid 19 vaccines could help fight vaccine hesitancy officials say CNN As a condition of the emergency use authorizations issued for the Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines those companies are expected to work toward asking the US Food and Drug Administration for full approval and some health officials are hoping it will happen soon Dr Sanjay Gupta looks into the origins of vaccine hesitancy Dr Fauci explains importance of vaccine approval process What medical professionals are doing to fight vaccine hesitancy These vaccines have been in use since mid December under emergency use authorizations known as EUAs During the pandemic real world data have shown the vaccines are against the coronavirus that causes Covid 19 Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told CNN s Jim Sciutto on Wednesday he hopes Covid 19 vaccines will receive full FDA approval very soon and that the FDA will work as expeditiously as possible on approval applications for coronavirus vaccines as they come in Progressing from authorized to approved would allow manufacturers to market and directly distribute their vaccines It could also have an impact on vaccine mandates and perhaps sway skeptics hesitant to get the vaccines now The road to FDA approval Currently the three Covid 19 vaccines distributed in the United States made by Pfizer BioNTech Moderna and Johnson Johnson are authorized but not approved Due to the seriousness of the pandemic vaccine makers originally applied for EUAs because the authorization process takes less time than what would be required for full approval Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests a medical product such as a vaccine that gets special FDA authorization to be used during an emergency When the health emergency is over then any EUA s issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect according to the FDA So vaccine makers will have to file a separate application for vaccines to be fully licensed CNN has contacted Pfizer BioNTech Moderna and Johnson Johnson the most recent Covid 19 vaccine to be authorized about their plans to apply for full approval of their vaccines None provided a timeline The typical approval process for vaccine developers requires completing lab research pre clinical testing and Phase 1 2 and 3 clinical trials in humans That has already been done for these coronavirus vaccines The FDA also requires vaccine manufacturers to submit data to support their manufacturing processes facilities product characterization and demonstration that the vaccine can be produced reliably and consistently Once all of that is complete both the clinical trials and manufacturing details companies can submit a Biologics License Application or BLA to the FDA By submitting a BLA to the FDA a company is seeking permission to distribute and market a vaccine for use in the United States according to the FDA s website FDA evaluates the data to determine whether the safety and ness of the vaccine has been demonstrated and whether the manufacturing and facility information assure product quality and consistency After its evaluation FDA decides whether to approve also known as to license the vaccine for use in the United States Applications designated as priority review mean the FDA s goal is to take action on an application within six months A standard review could take longer When you re getting a formal approval you have to have a certain amount of time just observing predominantly the safety and obviously the safety looks really really good in well over 140 million people having been vaccinated with at least a single dose Fauci said on CNN on Wednesday After all as spread of the virus is reduced the nation may no longer be under an emergency situation and the vaccines will need a different type of green light under the FDA The agency is the gold standard of a safety and regulatory organization throughout the world said Fauci chief medical adviser to President Biden I hope they do it quickly It will help show skeptics that the authorized Covid vaccines are safe A concern around authorized but unapproved vaccines hinges on vaccine hesitancy If history is any indication skepticism if not outright mistrust about an unapproved vaccine is nothing new One study published in 2009 months after the US declared a public health emergency due to the H1N1 influenza and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic researchers explored the public s willingness to use a drug or a vaccine with an EUA not full FDA approval by surveying a representative sample of more than 1 500 US adults The researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Georgia found that about 77 of respondents would be moderately very or extremely worried if offered an unapproved vaccine some 63 said they would not take it But the study also found that there were some other key factors that would convince respondents that a vaccine authorized under an EUA was safe to use If the vaccine were administered by a public health professional 55 of respondents said they would take it If it came with a fact sheet just over 57 of those surveyed said they would get it If their own health care provider administered the vaccine that number shot up to 68 Dr Jerome Adams US surgeon general during the Trump administration wrote in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post on Tuesday that approval will help show skeptics that the authorized coronavirus vaccines are safe We should also pursue full Food and Drug Administration approval and expand covid vaccinations to youths Adams wrote in part The individuals who got vaccinated early on were generally high risk and willing to take a vaccine authorized for emergency use But many people who are lower risk understandably ask if the benefits justify taking a medication that has not received the full and traditional FDA stamp of approval he wrote As vaccine manufacturers complete further studies which will eventually lead to expanded eligibility among minors it will help show skeptics that the authorized covid vaccines are safe Plans to require vaccines Some organizations say they expect to require the vaccine but have opted not to while it s authorized and not yet fully approved People when they hear it s still emergency use they still have a little concern about how far you can go with it Fauci said on CNN Wednesday The University of California and California State University systems announced last week that their universities intend to require faculty staff and students to be vaccinated against the coronavirus but the requirement would go into effect only once a vaccine has received full FDA approval The proposed policy would begin this fall The California State University noted in its announcement This requirement will become at the beginning of the fall 2021 term or upon full FDA approval of the vaccine whichever occurs later

Financial pitfalls NRIs should avoid while investing in India First generation Indian migrants are far more likely to return to India annually to visit family friends or relatives attend family events or travel across the country During these short trips they have been known to squeeze in their financial appointments for India based investment decisions This hasty process usually leads to critical investment decisions being pushed aside or delegated to relatives or friends which ultimately leads to financial pitfalls In our experience with NRIs some of the usual pitfalls they are known to fall into and must consciously try to avoid are as follows Investing as a resident Once an individual attains the status of an NRI he must convert his existing bank accounts to an NRE NRO or FCNR accounts As an NRI you can open an NRO account that are rupee designated accounts and are repatriable Similarly investment instruments like MFs direct equity bonds and more have their restrictions For instance an NRIs DEMAT account will need to be converted to an NRO DEMAT account while stock trading activities will need to be routed through a PIS Portfolio Investment Scheme account The rules and regulations are ever changing keen NRI investors need to keep abreast with these changes to avoid falling into the trap of losses Barred Investments Often NRI s tend to continue with their residential status based investment instruments as well ignoring processes and regulations For instance as an NRI settled in the USA there are restrictions to which mutual fund houses you are allowed to invest through This is due to the stringent compliance requirement by the USA Canada s regulatory body FATCA To avoid the complexities in compliance only a handful of investing houses accept investments from NRIs residing in the US For NRI s in other nations continuing with the current MFs may require a simple status change update by submitting the necessary documentation Also Read Why NRIs should use the mutual fund route to investments The taxation web Tax avoidance or double taxation is another pitfall that most NRIs fail to account for Income earned in India which exceeds the specified amount in the form of interest dividends from equity shares or MFs rent capital gain etc become liable for tax filing In some countries income earned in India could be taxable both in India as well as in the country of the NRIs residence To circumvent this double taxation burden on NRIs a tax treaty better known as the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement DTAA is signed between India and multiple countries This treaty assists in tackling the problem of tax avoidance as well as determines the efficient method implied to tax an NRI income This avoids double taxation and offers relief by reducing the burden of taxes on income earned provided a DTAA provision exists between the two countries Beyond intent the foremost reason for NRIs to default on taxes is unawareness linked to the Indian tax laws that are constantly changing Zero diversification Tying your portfolio to a single asset class or even a single country s fate is a gamble NRIs often fail to diversify their investments across asset classes and invest in fixed returns assets like FD s or physical assets like gold and real estate The reason for this tunneled vision could be correlated to avoidance of the complicated web of regulations transactional compliances and taxation by NRIs Reports suggest NRI investments in Indian real estate are likely to grow at 12 in FY22 The average prices of properties in leading markets like NCR and Mumbai showed flat growth in the October December period of 2020 as compared to the previous year 2019 Falling interest rates too have caused traditional asset classes like FD s and more to lose their sheen There are multiple avenues for NRIs to choose from that are both risky as well as secured Mutual funds NPS direct equity PPF and more are avenues that can be considered based on the financial goals of the investor be it early retirement post retirement planning or simply securing their dependents future Digital Assets The latest fad of Non Fungible Tokens NFTs and Cryptocurrency along with its ambiguity over its legality by Indian laws are leaving investors in a tizzy Young NRIs that are tech savvy often tend to invest massive amounts of their corpus in such digital assets Owing to its volatility and legal repercussions especially in India it is best if investors maintain investing in such assets within their allocated limit ensuring that its uncertainty or volatility does not put their complete financial portfolio at risk Also Read Here s a step by step guide for NRIs to retire rich Controlling Outflows Clearing off all forms of debt needs to be top a priority for every investor First generation NRIs who migrate often have loans for a home education or personal requirements They must ensure to plan repayment and pre payment of these loans from day 1 It is easy to get carried away and spend on lifestyle expenses in a new country Prudent planning ensures you stay in control of your expenses and invest efficiently especially during these unprecedented times of volatile markets job cuts visa delays and more As NRIs investing in Indian markets need not be a burdensome task Today in the post pandemic world processes and procedures have swiftly moved to online modes offering investors much transactional ease even if they are across borders The Indian markets are proving their grit and potential it is now time for NRIs to decide if they want to benefit from India s future potential

Royalties Plc Trident or the Company Q1 2021 Activities Update Transformational Lithium Royalty Acquisition Fundraising Continued Strength in Commodities Trident Royalties Plc AIM TRR FSX 5KV is pleased to provide an update on its activities undertaken during the first quarter ended 31 March 2021 including Q1 royalty receipts HIGHLIGHTS Q1 saw a significant increase in battery metals exposure in conjunction with an oversubscribed equity financing Trident completed its most significant transaction to date with the acquisition of a 60 interest in a gross revenue royalty GRR over the Thacker Pass Project Thacker Pass for a total consideration of US 28 0 million comprising US 26 0 million in cash and US 2 0 million in new ordinary shares in Trident Thacker Pass contains the largest defined lithium Mineral Reserve in the United States A successful concurrent equity financing of approximately GBP20 7 million approximately US 28 8 million was conducted at no discount to the prevailing market price to execute the Thacker Pass lithium royalty transaction and strengthen the balance sheet Trident completed the Talga gold royalties transaction and shortly post quarter end completed the previously announced Pukaqaqa copper royalties transaction finalising the acquisition of these seven royalties and With a portfolio inclusive of copper iron ore gold and now lithium Trident is increasingly reflective of the broader global mining sector providing investors with an inflation hedge in the face of loose global monetary policy and direct exposure to a once in a generation energy revolution Q1 royalty payments totalling approximately US 451 314 from royalties over producing assets an increase of 55 over Q4 2020 Royalty Stream Q1 2021 Payment Cumulative Payments since Acquisition Koolyanobbing iron A 100 479 A 2 740 884 ore royalty 1 Mimbula copper royalty US 375 000 US 453 707 Mimbula copper royalty payment of US 375 000 based on the Minimum Payment Schedule MPS under the royalty agreement representing a significant increase over Q4 2020 Q1 2021 production saw 671 tonnes of copper sold an increase over Q4 2020 as the project continues to ramp up The MPS on the Mimbula copper royalty continues in 2021 US 375 000 per quarter in 2021 less any excess payments made above the MPS from previous quarters increasing to US 500 000 per quarter in 2022 and US 750 000 for the first two quarters of 2023 2 Koolyanobbing iron ore royalty payment of A 100 479 US 76 314 3 a decrease over Q4 2020 on higher received price but lower volumes from the royalty area Trident notes the average grade at Koolyanobbing has fallen from 59 to 57 Fe since 2H20 Recent unprecedented strength in the iron ore market particularly for low grade fines products may incentivise operators to opportunistically favour production from lower grade areas in the short term 4 Trident s royalty covers a substantial portion of the Deception pit the highest grade deposit and a significant proportion of the total Koolyanobbing reserves Trident anticipates deferred production of this higher quality ore will benefit the Company in the short medium term Trident also notes the recent strategy overview presentation by Mineral Resources Limited the project operator which highlighted the impending finalisation of a 10 year plan for the Yilgarn Hub of which Koolyanobbing and its associated infrastructure is the central component Additionally Mineral Resources flagged the expansion of the Yilgarn Hub to 12Mtpa as a further growth opportunity and Commodity prices underlying Trident s royalty portfolio remained strong throughout Q1 2021 with iron ore averaging US 131 tonne copper averaging 8 503 tonne lithium carbonate equivalent LCE averaging US 9 083 tonne and gold averaging US 1 793 oz 5 Post quarter end copper has continued to climb to near 10 year highs while LCE prices have now doubled year to date to over US 13 500 tonne Q1 royalty portfolio growth combined with positive asset level progress by project operators Thacker Pass Lithium Project 6 In January 2021 Lithium Americas Corp LAC the project operator announced the receipt of the final key federal permit for the project followed shortly thereafter by a US 400 million equity fundraise primarily to fund the commencement of construction With the acquisition of 60 of the GRR Trident now has exposure to a key global lithium asset with a clear pathway to production Other highlights include Thacker Pass currently contains a CIM compliant Mineral Reserve of 3 1Mt LCE the largest lithium reserve in the United States with an anticipated mine life of 46 years based on reserves Thacker Pass is at an advanced stage of development with a highly attractive Pre Feasibility Study PFS announced on 21 June 2018 and a Definitive Feasibility Study due for completion in 2021 LAC has announced that key permits are in place with commencement of construction targeted for late 2021 or early 2022 and Trident expects Phase 1 production to start ramping up in 2024 The GRR is subject to a partial operator buy back which Trident expects will be exercised by LAC for proceeds to Trident of US 13 2 million during the first year of operation the Buyback Based on the PFS parameters published by LAC including an LCE price of 12 000 tonne Phase 1 steady state royalty revenue attributable to Trident is anticipated to be approximately US 3 8 million per annum increasing to US 7 6 million per annum at Phase 2 steady state assuming the Buy Back occurs before operations commence As anticipated the third party claimant has named Trident as a party to the existing litigation between Orion Resource Partners regarding the GRR The seller of the royalty has provided Trident with an indemnity subject to customary limitations and exclusions in respect of such proceedings Lake Rebecca Gold Project Apollo Consolidated Ltd Apollo the project operator has committed a material budget increase to advance the Lake Rebecca Gold Project 7 Lake Rebecca de risking the route to a future development decision Apollo has entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell its royalty interest over the Seguela Gold Project in Cote D Ivoire for A 20M cash It stated that the sale will add to existing cash reserves placing Apollo in a very strong position to take Rebecca forward Apollo announced the strategic acquisition of additional land tenure around Lake Rebecca to allow for full operational and planning flexibility as the company moves towards commercial studies 8 Apollo recently issued a JORC 2012 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate MRE update providing a 50 increase in Indicated Mineral Resources to 815 000 ounces to a combined total indicated and inferred optimised pit constrained 1 105M ounces gold Mineral Resource 9 The MRE update also noted the commencement of key technical studies to progress a potential 8 year mining and processing operation With A 37 1M in cash and receivables on hand Apollo remains well funded to aggressively advance Lake Rebecca 9 Additional geotechnical drilling on the eastern side of the Lake Rebecca deposit will assist in the outline of an optimised open pit shell for the proposed mine drilling has intersected wide zones of high grade gold mineralisation in two diamond drill holes located in the footwall of the Jennifer Structure 10 Apollo has stated the results from the two holes open potential for previously unknown structures to the east of the current resource with intersections up to 16m 4 12g t Au and 7 4m 4 70g t Au respectively Geotechnical drilling elsewhere on the project also intersected significant gold mineralisation Spring Hill Gold Project Trident notes the receipt of environmental approval for the Spring Hill Gold Project Spring Hill under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act EPBC The approval represents the achievement of a key milestone in the development of Spring Hill clearing the way for next steps toward development Pukaqaqa Copper Project Nexa Resources SA the project operator noted in its 2020 annual filing that the first part of pre feasibility metallurgical results for the Pukaqaqa Copper Project were concluded in December 2020 demonstrating better results than previous campaigns including improved recoveries and grades During 2021 variability tests to confirm results will be held The project budget has been increased by 60 from 2020 to US 2 4 million in 2021 to allow for further metallurgical testing and environmental closure works in the drilling area 11 Warrawoona Gold Project Calidus Resources Ltd Calidus the project operator is completing an integration study on its Blue Spec gold deposit to assess the economics of mining Blue Spec and trucking ore to the nearby Warrawoona plant potentially increasing the robustness of Warrawoona by increasing operating margins 12 In addition Caldius noted in its corporate presentation that Warrawoona will commence main construction this quarter as well as confirming that construction is fully funded and on schedule to pour first gold as planned in the first half of 2022 Mosquito Creek Gold Project Calidus has entered into a Farm In Agreement with Nimble Resources 13 the project operator which gives Calidus the right to earn up to 90 of the Mosquito Creek tenement E46 1035 located about 75km from its Warrawoona gold project and in the vicinity of the Blue Spec mining proposition E46 1035 is located along strike of two geochemical trends identified on tenements immediately to the west Calidus states that many soil and rock chip anomalies on the tenement have not been previously followed up with drilling and fieldwork will start in earnest this calendar year Koolyanobbing Iron Ore Project In its Q3 FY2021 quarterly results 14 Mineral Resources Limited stated that 2 5 million tonnes of iron ore were shipped from the Yilgarn Hub for the quarter Trident holds a 1 5 free on board royalty over the M77 1259 tenement which covers a substantial part of the Deception pit which forms part of the broader Koolyanobbing iron ore operation in Western Australia Mimbula Copper Project Production continues to ramp up at the Mimbula Copper Project and with the copper price recently touching near 10 year highs supported by solid fundamentals the project is well positioned to capitalise on continued positive market sentiment Strong balance sheet to support future acquisitions Unaudited cash balance of US 7 4 million as of 31 March 2021 not inclusive of Q1 royalty revenue which was received post quarter end This substantial cash balance coupled with ongoing projected revenues from two cash generative royalties and an ability to offer vendors publicly tradeable equity in Trident supports capacity for future acquisitions In addition Trident entered into a term sheet with Tribeca Global Resources Credit Pty Ltd during Q1 in respect of a proposed debt facility up to an amount of US 10 million The Facility is subject to the finalisation of definitive documents and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent Indicative of the strength of the pipeline Trident currently has 11 active NDAs under which it is reviewing a range of opportunities across commodities including mineral sands lead nickel copper gold zinc cobalt potash and iron ore and Trident continues to prioritise production or near production assets in order to materially build Trident s near term revenue profile Adam Davidson Chief Executive Officer of Trident commented The first quarter of 2021 was perhaps the most significant for Trident since its admission to trading on AIM less than a year ago with the 28 million acquisition of 60 of the Thacker Pass lithium royalty coupled with a substantial equity raise The fundraising was conducted at no discount to the prevailing share price was significantly oversubscribed and has resulted in a number of new institutional holders establishing a position in the Company In addition to funding our Thacker Pass transaction we have a very healthy balance sheet to support the continued growth and diversification of our royalty portfolio both through acquisition as well as positive asset level progress This bodes exceptionally well for Trident particularly against a global macro backdrop that is increasingly supportive of growing demand for critical commodities Within the last quarter we ve seen material positive updates at Lake Rebecca Spring Hill and the Western Australian Gold Royalty package tenements Revenue continues to remain volatile across Trident s two paying royalties a factor which underpins the opportunity available to Trident by which it can acquire single asset royalties at attractive valuations from natural sellers to ultimately construct a diversified portfolio of royalties with a more predictable payment profile Trident remains focused on executing value accretive transactions across the commodity and development space with a particular focus on enhancing near term revenue References 1 Inclusive of GST 2 Source Trident Royalties announcement dated 29

investors with exposure to a mix of base and precious metals bulk materials excluding thermal coal and battery metals Key highlights of Trident s strategy include Building a royalty and streaming portfolio to broadly mirror the commodity exposure of the global mining sector excluding thermal coal with a bias towards production or near production assets differentiating Trident from the majority of peers which are exclusively or heavily weighted to precious metals Acquiring royalties and streams in resource friendly jurisdictions worldwide while most competitors have portfolios focused on North and South America Targeting attractive small to mid size transactions which are often ignored in a sector dominated by large players Active deal sourcing which in addition to writing new royalties and streams will focus on the acquisition of assets held by natural sellers such as closed end funds prospect generators junior and mid tier miners holding royalties as non core assets and counterparties seeking to monetise packages of royalties and streams which are otherwise undervalued by the market Maintaining a low overhead model which is capable of supporting a larger scale business without a commensurate increase in operating costs and Leveraging the experience of management the board of directors and Trident s adviser team all of whom have deep industry connections and strong transactional experience across multiple commodities and jurisdictions The acquisition and aggregation of individual royalties and streams is expected to deliver strong returns for shareholders as assets are acquired on terms reflective of single asset risk compared with the lower risk profile of a diversified larger scale portfolio Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt Once scale has been achieved strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection growth and income Forward looking Statements This news release contains forward looking information The statements are based on reasonable assumptions and

Main Event April 22 2021 An Angle On This Show Main Event Date April 22 2021 Location Yuengling Center Tampa Florida Commentators Kevin Patrick Byron Saxton The Wrestlemania fallout continues and that means we are on the way to Wrestlemania Backlash because now we have something else called Wrestlemania I m not sure how much you can expect from this show but you can almost guarantee who you are going to see doing it Let s get to it Here are last week s results if you need a recap Opening sequence Mansoor vs Akira Tozawa Tozawa takes him down into a chinlock and then switches over to a headlock That s reversed into a cradle so they get back up and run the ropes with Mansoor dropping down three times in a row Tozawa eventually trips over him but is right back with a Shining Wizard for two The backsplash gets the same and with both of them sitting they chop it out It s Tozawa getting the better of things and grabs a chinlock but Mansoor fights back up with a spinebuster The DDT gives Mansoor two so Tozawa sends him to the apron allowing Mansoor to come back with the slingshot neckbreaker for the pin at 5 33 Rating C Just another Mansoor win here as the winning streak continues as we move towards another Saudi Arabia show I m not sure if it is going to be anything noteworthy in the end but Mansoor is having good enough matches against decent opponents It would be nice if that meant something before they go overseas again but I would be stunned if we saw that Quick look at Roman Reigns retaining at Wrestlemania From Smackdown Here is Roman Reigns flanked by Jey Uso and Paul Heyman After looking around for a bit Reigns has Heyman explain the kind of competition he had to face Heyman explains who Daniel Bryan and Edge are allowing Reigns to talk about how no one is on his level He has done everything he was asked to do and stacked up the competition to pin them both at once With that out of the way cut the check and fire up the jet Reigns goes to leave but here s Cesaro to interrupt which gets Reigns attention He leaves anyway as Cesaro stares him all the way to Wrestlemania Backlash From Smackdown Cesaro vs Jey Uso Uso sends him into the ropes to start but Cesaro gets in a quick slam to take over Cesaro takes him to the apron and goes after Cesaro s hand but gets knocked to the floor The dive off of the apron drops Uso and we take a break We come back with Uso work working on the arm to try and keep Cesaro down Uso goes up but gets caught with a dropkick A gutwrench superplex gives Cesaro two and he cartwheels out of an armdrag Cesaro nails a springboard uppercut and McAfee is rather impressed Uso is back with a pop up neckbreaker for two but Cesaro nails a discus lariat The Swing goes on but here is Seth Rollins to jump Cesaro for the DQ at 11 10 Rating C Good enough while it lasted but they telegraphed the ending the entire night with the UFO clip That isn t a terrible thing but it also didn t give us the most drama Cesaro is looking primed for a one off shot against Reigns but it also might be better to have him beat Rollins again first Reigns isn t going to lose to Cesaro so building him up a bit more first is a good way to make Wrestlemania not seem like a fluke Post match Rollins lays him out and shouts that Cesaro got lucky The sooner Cesaro figures that out the better it is for him Quick look at Drew McIntyre winning a triple threat to become the new 1 contender to Bobby Lashley but getting laid out by Mace and T Bar From Raw Here is Drew McIntyre to get things going We get a recap of him winning a triple threat match last week to become 1 contender to Bobby Lashley After the win he was attacked by Mace and T Bar with MVP looking on in approval With the recap of last week out of the way McIntyre recaps last week McIntyre gets to Mace and T Bar but he doesn t believe that they are the masterminds here That would be MVP which has McIntyre wondering if Mace and T Bar are going to start wearing those nice suits Cue MVP who implies he didn t know anything about it causing Drew to mock him for suggesting he didn t know anything about it MVP says Lashley is expecting McIntyre to be a worthy challenger at Wrestlemania Backlash As for Mace and T Bar Lashley recently decided to downsize the Hurt Business so why would he need those two after he already beat McIntyre at Wrestlemania Mace and T Bar have ZERO affiliation with the Hurt Business McIntyre doesn t seem to buy it but here are Mace and T Bar to jump him again The double sitout chokeslam drops McIntyre and the two walk past MVP who doesn t really respond From Raw Drew McIntyre vs Mace T Bar No partner for McIntyre who charges at T Bar and hammers away to start A kick to the face sets up a battle over a suplex with McIntyre pulling it off for two MVP is watching in the back as Mace comes in to unload on McIntyre in the corner Some running knees put McIntyre down and we hit the chinlock and go to a wide shot to show off the Thunderdome for some reason ala Vince McMahon in the mid 90s pay per views Mace suplexes him for two but McIntyre hits T Bar with a spinebuster for two The Glasgow Kiss slows T Bar down but Mace s distraction lets the double teaming begin The referee throws it out at 5 57 Rating C This didn t have time to go very far but at least Mace and T Bar didn t get pinned right out of the box It isn t a win but they lost because they were beating McIntyre up instead of a result of the opposite I m still curious about where this goes though I have next to no confidence in it going anywhere positive for them in the long term Immediately after the bell here s Braun Strowman to clear off not Retribution Load up the tag match Braun Strowman Drew McIntyre vs T Bar Mace Yeah you knew it was coming as soon as the music hit Strowman powers out of a headlock to start and then runs Mace over with a shoulder Drew certainly likes that and Braun forearms Mace down T Bar comes in and is pounded down into the corner as well A Mace distraction lets T Bar get in a chop block though and we hit the reverse chinlock T Bar knees him in the back and grabs another chinlock but Strowman backdrops his way to freedom The hot tag brings in McIntyre to pick up the pace including an overhead belly to belly to Mace There s a jumping neckbreaker into McIntyre s nip up and there goes Mace s mask Commentary doesn t seem to recognize him as a former member of their family even as McIntyre hits him with the mask for the DQ at 5 24 Rating C Just a tag match here but losing the mask might get rid of a little bit of the Retribution stigma Again this is better than the team getting pinned though it still isn t exactly the best way to make them seem like big stars either They went with another tag formula match here and that was fine though it would be nice to see Mace and T Bar pin someone Like ever Post match Strowman rips off T Bar s mask and knocks him outside as well The start of non Retribution s theme sounds like Neville s NXT music Stills of Bianca Belair winning the Smackdown Women s Title at Wrestlemania From Smackdown Here are the Street Profits to take part in Bianca Belair s championship celebration Back from a break with the Profits talking about how Wrestlemania was a night to remember but there was one match that stood out about the others We get a video on Belair beating Sasha Banks to win the SmackDown Women s Title including the media attention that followed Montez Ford talks about how special that was and brings out Belair to for the big presentation as champion Belair takes her time soaking in a loud EST chant and says she can t believe she got here If you told her she would be here with this title well she probably would have said yes because that is who she is You should never apologize for being the b e s t because if you can dream it you can do it Then there is Sasha Banks who pushed her like no one ever has and both of them made history They both did but Belair is the champ The title is for everyone who believed in her and they are just getting started creating history They all hug but Belair tells Ford to get back to business because it s time to get some more gold Lince Dorado vs Drew Gulak Gran Metalik is here with Lince They go to the mat to start and get nowhere so let s have a standoff instead Gulak takes him down by the leg and grabs a hammerlock That s broken up so Gulak takes him down into a chinlock instead Dorado is back up again and snaps off a running hurricanrana so Gulak plants him with a side slam We take a break and come back with commentary explaining that there is a wager on the match if Gulak wins he gets 1000 but if he loses he has to wash the House Party s laundry I m not sure if I should be more amazed by there being an actual angle or by commentary forgetting to mention that until a few minutes into the match Anyway Gulak hits a sitout powerbomb for two and we re back in the chinlock Dorado fights up and gets two off a backslide followed by a Lionsault press for two more There s a faceplant for the third two in a row but Gulak electric chair faceplants him into something like an STF With that broken up Dorado hits a superkick into the shooting star press for the pin at 10 46 Rating C Good stuff here which shouldn t be surprising Ignoring the match though while it was a low level idea just having SOMETHING on this match made it feel more important I can t imagine this took more than ten seconds to put together and if they throw in a quick vignette or promo to pay it off next week great I can t imagine it is that hard to ask the wrestlers to come up with some idea like this one and it at least made the match feel a tiny bit important No it probably won t last but I ll take it We recap Charlotte s return followed by her costing Asuka a title shot against Rhea Ripley From Raw Here is Charlotte for a chat She is tired of the lack of respect from the women s locker room Wrestlemania was taken away from her and that just wasn t fair She can beat Asuka and Rhea Ripley on the same night so tonight Asuka is getting taken out as Ripley sees what Charlotte can do Cue Asuka and Ripley with the latter being willing to take Charlotte up on her offer even though Asuka is beating her tonight Asuka goes to say something but Charlotte cuts her off and condescendingly reminds her of the Wrestlemania match Asuka promises to beat her tonight b I would pay a good bit of money to come up with any new way to present Charlotte other than the I m better than all of you heel And From Raw Asuka vs Charlotte Rhea Ripley comes out to watch as Charlotte grabs a headlock They fall out to the floor in a heap though and it s off to an early break Back with Charlotte hammering away but Asuka scores with a knee to the face A Shining Wizard leg kick according to Virk as the completely understandable learning curve continues drops Charlotte but what looked like a Codebreaker completely misses Thankfully commentary doesn t try to hide it as they slug it out from their knees Charlotte is up with a spear for two and then heads to the apron Asuka s kick to the ribs is blocked and Charlotte wrenches on the knee as long as she can Back in and the Asuka Lock sends Charlotte to the ropes so she takes Asuka s bad leg out again The Figure Eight goes on but Ripley breaks it up meaning the fight is on Asuka kicks Charlotte in the arm and crucifixes her for the pin at 9 16 though Charlotte s shoulder was a bit off the mat Rating C I know Charlotte loses here and it seems to set up Asuka vs Ripley II but come on You know Charlotte is getting in that title match because that is what Charlotte does almost every single time It s going to happen no matter what and it wouldn t shock me to see her win the title again I would certainly hope not but it isn t like it would be unprecedented Post match Charlotte yells at the referee and beats him down even continuing as other referees come out to yell at her Overall Rating C I liked the original stuff more than usual because it had a little bonus for the first time in well years but the rest of the show just brought up how dull Raw has been The big Charlotte features at the end were hard to watch and the only saving grace is that it isn t Mandy Rose Dana Brooke vs Nia Jax Reigns and Cesaro could be interesting though and that alone puts Smackdown above Raw It s a bad time in WWE right now and given that Wrestlemania was less than two weeks ago that should be rather scary Remember to follow me on Twitter and head

Industrial Investment Gold plummets or peaks Canadian dollar is as strong as open Fundamentals On April 30 the US dollar repaired the decline after the Fed 39 s interest rate resolution on Thursday and further expanded its gains after the strong US GDP data Although it gave up some of the gains late in the trading session it still closed the day Data show that the United States 39 actual annualized GDP in the first quarter of this year increased by 6 4 from the initial value setting the best GDP record since 2003Q3 but it was lower than the estimated value of 6 7 and the previous value of 4 3 The data confirms that the US economy is rebounding faster than other major countries stimulated by vaccination economic reopening and more loose fiscal policies However given that the Fed has firmly stated earlier it is too early to consider the gradual withdrawal of emergency aid A single U S economic data may have limited boost to the dollar unless more economic data prompts the market to believe that the Fed will have to change its current easing stance soon The Canadian dollar has performed strongly among non US currencies thanks to the Central Bank of Canada 39 s interest rate decision this month not only cutting other aspects but also paying attention to the Eurozone GDP and the US PCE price index Although the US dollar rebounded slightly overnight the overall weakness has not changed If there is no more data to highlight the US dollar economy leading other economies the US dollar may be difficult to reverse Technically the daily chart of EUR USD pulled back slightly overnight but the overall upward trend remained intact Pay attention to the 5 day moving average support The 4 hour chart is in a narrow range and remains bullish The hourly chart corrected the previous day 39 s gains but the strength was not strong It is recommended to operate cautiously during the day and maintain the above 1 2100 to continue to be bullish Support level 1 2100 1 2070 1 2050 Resistance level 1 2150 1 2180 1 2200 The rebound momentum of the daily chart of GBP USD since the 1 3667 low point remains intact but short term action is not strong The 4 hour chart is finishing at a high rebound and is still expected to break through The hourly chart has little volatility overnight and there are still upside opportunities In the day it is recommended to go long above 1 3920 and follow up above 1 3975 Support level 1 3920 1 3900 1 3860 Resistance level 1 3975 1 4000 1 4020 USD JPY daily chart upside signs of resistance at the 50 day moving average line pay attention to the resistance of this line The 4 hour chart tests the 109 20 line and only a break above that can open up further upside space The hourly chart as a whole sees a saw below 109 00 lacking direction It is recommended to pay attention to the performance of 109 05 in the day to determine the further direction Support level 108 75 108 55 108 25 resistance level 109 05 109 25 109 50 The golden daily chart repeatedly encounters the suppression of the 100 day moving average and has a bearish sign but it needs to effectively break below the 20 day moving average to open up further downside space In the 4 hour chart support is looming on the 1765 front line and the overall trend is still weak The hourly chart is corrected after the big Yinxian and it is still bearish It is recommended to go short below 1780 in the day and follow up below 1762 Support level 1762 1752 1737 Resistance level 1780 1785 1795 The stochastic indicator on the daily chart maintains a downward trend and the sideways trend below 26 60 is bearish The 4 hour chart was repeatedly blocked at 26 50 but it needs to break below 25 75 to open up further downside space After the hourly chart the correction is blocked by MA200 which is still bearish It is recommended to go short below 26 15 in the day and follow up below 25 75 Support levels 25 75 25 40 24 70 Resistance levels 26 15 26 50 26 65

Originally posted by Pharmagang Alright team what an awesome day This was a huge derisk in a single announcement This had one of the biggest question marks around it The results of the ARDS trial weighed heavy on a lot Let s acknowledge how big a deal this is a huge 75 reduction in mortality of Rem l Dex relative to Dex alone 43 reduction in mortality in their own right deal That is a 75 improvement on the standard of care for a disease that is killing 800 people in the US per day reducing mortality to just 12 from 43 This clearly shows that Rem L is an effective treatment against Covid 19 ARDS which is clearly still a massive unmet medical need Not only does it show this but the FDA now has RCT data for safetyRCT data for biomarkers ie mechanism of action RCT data for a strong signal of efficacy 26 vs 42 p 0 048 alone 14 vs 45 in combination with Dex p 0 006 for a cytokine syndrome like diseaseWhy do I point this out Rem L is also under review for regulatory pathways to market in GvHD This gives gold standard RCT data on all of the above for Remestemcel L this data as SI alluded to in the CC will aid in FDA discussions regarding the best path forward for GvHD The FDA could have even agreed to hold out to review this data prior to making a binding decision on GvHD that would explain the delays It s not the same disease but you know we have some pretty clear efficacy shown by a met primary endpoint to show we treat GvHD For people who aren t too familiar with stats and p values that means that there was a 48 1000 and 6 1000 chance that this data could have happened by chance respectively I m happy with those odds as will most people including the FDA as p 0 05 is the standard for significance I saw one dude be like Yea but they only just got under 05 this doesn t give me confidence I die a little reading this You are saying that less than a 50 1000 chance of this happening by chance is insufficient evidence for you to back this result What about the 6 1000 as a combination therapy How many times do you need to run into a concrete wall before you finally believe it s a dumb idea smh Also addressing EUA this is definitely on the cards but thank god MSB seem to be becoming more conservative in their estimates and saying another trial right off the bat The 4th point is demonstrated by the massive improvement on top of the current standard of care Dexamethasone Who knows but we certainly have a worthy application So looking forward things we know Surg Centre no doubt under an NDA to allow for a complete review of the internal functioning of the company put down US 110 million at 2 30 Means there are probably no shady dealings considering they appointed a SurgCentre official to the board Novartis held out to review data for ARDS before deciding on the next stepsEach of the pursued indications by the company reflects massive market opportunities Things I consider almost certain Gruenthal European partnership money and trial initiation for CLBPNovartis partnership money and trial for ARDS After being told that the trial failed what results could you possibly hope for other than what we got A statistically significant lasting reduction in mortality up to 60 days that synergistically works with the SoC and a reduction in discharge time Considering they stayed on following the trial I don t believe in the face of this kind of data that Novartis would walk that would be insane The CEO of Novartis even gave us a shout out shortly after 1 24 SP gain on analysis of secondary markers from ARDS trial similar to in January with the CHF results Progression of Tasly partnership in ChinaEventual CHF partnership for US EU commercialisation of RexlemestrocelThings I consider moderately risky GvHD commercialisation has been massively derisked for the reasons highlighted above but everything the FDA did with this one was weird so what s to stop them now I think more likely to get conditional approval than not but that s just imo based on the new evidence presented by the ARDS RCT CHF requiring a single trial Coin flip tbh We certainly have the data to validate it but FDA wild card makes it too hard to call Regardless I strongly believe we will get a lucrative partnership prior to commercialisation CLBP requiring a single trial Ditto coin flip but I think CHF is slightly more likely to land the right way up EUA for Covid ARDS We tick all the boxes and the pandemic calls for it but they re not given lightly Is this the path to approval for the first approved commercial stem cell therapy in the US All just my thoughts and not investment advice I did top up though following my own thought process Gang Gang Expand Thanks Gang gang have posted on Yahoo too Mesoblast Limited MESO NasdaqGS NasdaqGS Real Time Price Currency in USDIn watchlist7 22 0 10 1 37 At close 4 00PM EDT8 18 0 96 13 30 Pre Market 4 00AM EDT

Re Bitcoin or Gold Quote from BIN BIN on Today at 07 45 23 AMSince gold is more stable for long term holding investors will prefer to go for gold against bitcoin Bitcoin is new just a decade old currency but gold has been around for so many years over 100 years So the two can not be compared but again bitcoin has grown magnificently so it offers quick returns In my opinion not all investors choose Gold for long term investments because if we really want quick returns we should prefer Bitcoin As we all know the volatile Bitcoin price can generate a much greater profit than Gold but indeed the risk is also much higher So for investors who are looking for it to be safe they definitely prefer Gold over Bitcoin So in the end back to each of us because I prefer quick returns I prefer investing in Bitcoin And it is proven that I managed to get a large profit from Bitcoin this year because the increase in Bitcoin this year is very significant when compared to Gold

Nigel Farage Brexiteer scourge of the woke and eco warrior FILE PHOTO British Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage speaks during a visit at Dover harbour in Dover By Susanna Twidale LONDON Reuters Love him or hate him it s hard to accuse Nigel Farage of being boring or predictable and Britain s Brexit champion has blindsided his critics once again Fresh from leaving politics the most high profile face of the campaign to leave the European Union has joined the advisory board of a Dutch carbon offset company aiming to plant three trillion trees by 2030 It may seem an unlikely career choice for a man who has been scathing about wind power criticised some environmental campaigners for what he called climate alarmism and declared war on the woke agenda Yet Farage said the attraction of the new role as an adviser and spokesman with Amsterdam listed carbon offset company Dutch Green Business DGB was about conservation and nature rather than just combating climate change on which he says the science is still not completely settled I think people will want to plant trees and increase biodiversity through DGB who are actually quite sceptical about climate change Equally there will be others who are very concerned about it the 57 year old told Reuters If their motivations are more about biodiversity than they are about climate change so what he said DGB CEO Selwyn Duijvestijn said the very image that made Farage appear an unlikely choice would help to broaden the company s message to reach people beyond those traditionally interested in nature 50 of the world love the Greta Thunbergs of this world to bring them the message that nature is important but then there is the other 50 the oil workers in Texas for instance and they would rather listen to Nigel Duijvestijn said Yet some established figures in the carbon market expressed concern over the appointment We are astonished that an organisation that presumably seeks to be seen as credible has enlisted as a spokesperson and adviser someone who has wilfully impeded progress on climate action by sowing doubt about the reality and urgency of climate change said Sarah Leugers director of communications at Gold Standard one of the biggest carbon offset registries DGB s first offsets have been bought from a forest project in Sierra Leone from established decarbonisation project developer South Pole but Duijvestijn says it expects to develop future projects itself Farage s entrance may force DGB to hasten that transition South Pole said it was concerned about his appointment and had decided to forgo future agreements with the company Responding to the criticisms DGB said Farage was an agent for change who can be a force for good in championing reforestation Carbon offsets or credits are generated by emissions reduction projects such as tree planting or shifts to less polluting fuels These credits are then bought by companies or individuals to help compensate for their own emissions Currently the market is small with a mostly bilateral project by project approach But with more and more companies announcing net zero climate targets the market is expected to balloon over the coming years attracting more financial institutions Some exchanges such as CME have launched futures offset contracts this year and DGB said it hoped to harness the commodities expertise of Farage who spent years as a trader on the London Metal Exchange

Can Utah Republicans survive an emerging sea of blue in the West That s what s at stake and why the race for Utah s next Republican leader matters outgoing Utah GOP chairman says Share this story Share All sharing options for As surrounding states in the West continue to trend Democratic will Utah remain a red stronghold Or will it eventually become overtaken in an emerging sea of blue That s what s at stake for Utah Republicans in the race for the Utah GOP s next chairperson a position largely off the radar of a public consumed by COVID 19 updates and the promise of better weather Yet when delegates make their selection from five candidates at this weekend s state convention it will help determine the future of their party and its influence on Utah politics said Derek Brown the state GOP s outgoing chairman who announced last month he wouldn t be seeking another term to spend more time with his family Anyone who is paying attention to the trends and to the numbers who is a Republican should be very concerned Brown told the Deseret News in an interview this week The demographic and geographic trends are not boding well for Republicans both nationally and here in the state of Utah Rewind to the year 2000 when George W Bush beat Al Gore for president That year the entire western U S voted red except for Oregon California Washington and purple New Mexico though New Mexico tipped blue on a fraction of a percentage point Since then one by one we ve had states surrounding Utah that have flipped blue Brown said New Mexico though it voted red in 2004 flipped Democratic in 2008 for former President Barack Obama and has since stayed blue Other purple states like Colorado and Nevada have faded blue Then Arizona a state that has voted red since 2000 made the flip last year when the state turned blue for President Joe Biden That is a Democratic shift in the western U S that does not bode well for Republicans and we have not done a good job nationally of addressing it Brown said describing the difficulties Republicans have had engaging millennial voters and unifying around their platform Outgoing Utah GOP chairman Derek Brown looks over county signs at the party s headquarters in Salt Lake City on Wednesday April 28 2021 Jeffrey D Allred Deseret News Nate Silver the editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight who is a well known predictor of political elections last year said people underrate the chance that Utah could become a swing state in another couple of cycles In 2017 Silver told the Deseret News he s fascinated by Utah because it looks and breathes like a blue state even though it s traditionally red He said Utah increasingly has the markers of a blue state meaning high education levels big tech sector young population So you can kind of envision a world in eight years 12 years 16 years in which Utah behaves more like Colorado or something right And this was before COVID Brown said Add in the pandemic which Brown said has put these concerning trends for Republicans on steroids because of the number of people moving from other states like New York or California and flooding Utah The people coming here that may help our economy but it will definitely have an impact on the political landscape Brown said So while the Utah GOP for decades has had the luxury of a super majority Brown said assuming that luxury will last forever could spell trouble for Utah Republicans The luxury of a super majority can also allow a party to be sloppy and unfocused and still win elections Brown said My concern is we may not have that luxury in the next five to 10 years And whether that is the case has everything to do with the party remaining strong and funded Brown said he saw it happen in Arizona last year where he said a weak and fractured party focused on infighting lost in a crucial presidential year and lost a Republican seat in the U S Senate My concern is whenever a party becomes weak and unfunded and unfocused and allows itself to engage in infighting the day follows the night The party will begin to lose elections he said And we in Utah have not done that in the last few years We have reversed that trend But as a party we need to remain vigilant or else we will go the way of our surrounding states Outgoing Utah GOP chairman Derek Brown looks over old caucus signs that weren t used due to COVID 19 at the party s headquarters in Salt Lake City on Wednesday April 28 2021 Jeffrey D Allred Deseret News Utah s GOP Before Brown was elected in May 2019 the Utah GOP was plagued by inner turmoil divided into camps by years of infighting over the controversial election law SB54 and in debt owing more than 137 000 They couldn t pay their bills Brown said They had just lost a number of races including a congressional seat and the fundraising was abysmal In 2018 former Rep Ben McAdams beat former Rep Mia Love and became the first Democrat to win a congressional seat in Utah since 2012 Fast forward two years Brown said We pulled the party out of debt within a month or two The party is unified in a way that it hasn t been notwithstanding the challenges we ve faced We ve raised over 1 million And we ve won almost every election we ve set out to win including the seat in Congress that we lost Rep Burgess Owens last year defeated McAdams and took back Utah s 4th Congressional District seat for Republicans Now the Utah GOP must continue in the positive direction Brown said Who emerges during the weekend convention to become chairperson vice chairman secretary and treasurer will set the future course Who will lead The most important thing for a party is to support the candidates and support the brand and have an organization that is well funded and organizationally sound Brown said For me this election is about are we going to continue to move that direction or are we going to major in minor things Sometimes I think political parties can focus on internal squabbles that don t necessarily help them win elections Brown said he needed to remain neutral ahead of Saturday s convention so he didn t have any endorsements or anti endorsements for the candidates vying to take his place But Brown did list some characteristics he believes the Utah GOP s chairperson needs to have including the basic ability to raise funds effectively the ability to understand how elections are managed and won while also having the temperament and ability to unite Utah s Republicans rather than divide Unity and civility is a style of politics employed by Gov Spencer Cox who successfully won his election last year and has seen upward trending approval ratings It s also a style that s the opposite of the leader national and the majority of Utah Republicans coalesced around in 2016 and 2020 former President Donald Trump Trump s divisive and polarizing style ultimately fell short on the national level in November last year In Utah division and polarization is not a style that s typically successful and not one that Brown said will position Utah s GOP for success Someone who is a unifier and someone who cannot just recognize that you have people all over the political spectrum in one party but someone who actually reaches out to all of them to bring them together is the best way forward Brown said I think someone who is divisive and focused on their own personal agenda not only will they not unify the party but they will force anyone who differs with them from the party And for a state like Utah that may trend blue Brown said that s exactly the opposite of what we need to do The candidates Five candidates are running to succeed Brown and they range in backgrounds and demographics A look at who they are provides a picture of the GOP in Utah There s Tina Cannon a former Morgan County GOP chairwoman and Morgan County councilwoman who would be the first woman to lead Utah s GOP There s Stewart Peay current chairman of the Utah County Republican Party who s been endorsed by Gov Spencer Cox and Lt Gov Deidre Henderson among other legislative leaders There s Brad Baker who at 22 is likely the youngest state party candidate in Utah s party s history There s Carson Jorgensen a 31 year old sheep rancher with a passion for agriculture and public lands And there s Scott Miller former Salt Lake County GOP chairman who resigned amid controversy last month but for which he has since rescinded his apology defending himself by saying he d been Kavanaughed Scott Miller Miller who lives in Riverton and was chairman of the Salt Lake County GOP for more than three years made headlines last month after he was accused by multiple women within the Salt Lake County GOP for allowing bullying to occur within the party Scott Miller Scott Miller While his four opponents agreed to phone interviews with the Deseret News this week for this story Miller did not accept multiple requests for an interview and only answered questions via email After initially calling the women accusers sore losers who failed to win their respective races in an email last month that preempted the first media report of the accusations Miller later resigned and apologized saying he made a mistake with how I handled the complaints Since then Miller s backtracked In an email sent to the Deseret News on Tuesday Miller said he had withdrawn his apology I stand by my actions he wrote Throughout the campaign I immediately addressed any and all issues and complaints and I have documentation and witnesses to prove it I never heard several of the complaints until it was presented in the press Miller also wrote he s been Kavanaughed comparing himself to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh the federal judge who was accused of sexual assault from the 80s during his 2018 confirmation hearings I believe certain women and others strategically timed salatious sic allegations against me to derail my campaign for state chair he wrote Many Utah Republicans seem to believe in guilt by accusation and seem intent to deny due process to the accused This is very disturbing He added I believe we have an obligation to investigate Miller wrote We need to get to the bottom of this issue Let s have due process a fair investigation and let the public see the facts Miller argues he s the right person to lead Utah s GOP saying under his leadership the Salt Lake County GOP successfully turned the Salt Lake County Council from purple to red He wrote he ll keep Utah from turning purple by seeking to expand the Republican tent We expanded the tent in Salt Lake County We recruited and encouraged good candidates saying those candidates included women and people from diverse backgrounds We helped elect a greek a doctor and Congressman Burgess Owens an African American Tina Cannon Cannon 53 has 20 years of experience within the Utah Republican Party She served as chairwoman for the Morgan County GOP as well as a state convention committee member and a state convention credentials chairwoman She was twice elected as a Morgan County councilwoman She ran a bid last year to represent Utah s 1st Congressional District but faltered in the Republican convention Tina Cannon Tina Cannon If it s a strong organizational structure and fundraising backbone the Utah GOP needs Cannon argues she s the only candidate in this race that has that fundraising experience pointing to her congressional run It wasn t until after Brown announced he was stepping down and she started getting phone calls from supporters that Cannon said she d considered running to replace him And then when the Salt Lake County GOP Miller controversy hit headlines and she said her phone blew up I was having a lot of friends in the party particularly male friends who were very concerned about the message this was sending and felt like it was time for another perspective she said There are very few women in Republican politics in Utah Cannon said and we each have our stories But she said that story did not represent the majority of men in Utah s GOP noting she s had incredible mentors supporters and donors But she worried that story wasn t being told and that s sad to me Because when women see this it discourages them from running she said Politics is hard Politics is a blood sport And women don t run for the same reasons that men do Women run to do something Men run to be something So Cannon said she decided to step into this chaos a decision she made 45 minutes before the filing deadline on April 1 in order to encourage good women to run When other women don t see other women who are strong enough qualified and win they don t run she said This is a difficult thing Cannon added because I don t want to run as a woman I m not running because I m a woman I m the best candidate I have by far the most experience and the best background Running as the only female candidate isn t a message that will resonate with Utah GOP delegates she said It s about being well qualified At the same time increased diversity is what the Utah Republican party needs as it looks to the future Cannon said We need to have a diversity of voices at the table because we are losing that demographic at the Republican Party Stewart Peay Peay 47 a lawyer who lives in Alpine was elected as chairman of the Utah County GOP in April 2019 By day Peay works as a partner at Snell Wilmer where he s worked for 18 years He also served in the Utah National Guard for 13 years including a tour in Iraq Stewart Peay Stewart Peay In his two years as Utah County GOP chairman Peay said he spent that time unifying Utah County Republicans which is no small task When he first came to the post Peay said the county Republicans couldn t get along to make decisions at the executive committee level and he attributed that as a big reason why Love lost to McAdams in 2018 Last year Peay said the Utah County GOP energized more voters and helped push Owens to victory One of the key things I did in Utah County is listen to everybody Peay said I encourage all parties to bring forward their positions then as a leadership group we figure out a resolution that works for our party It s not perfect for everyone but it s great for the party and that s what we need The emerging blue sea around Utah in the West the changing political landscape and the threat it poses to Republicans future in Utah is why I m running for the statewide party chairperson position During the past two years Peay credited Miller for getting the party back on track and I feel like we need to stay on that track if we re going to defend our traditional Republican values and strongholds here in Utah As Utah s population changes and as more people move in from states like California Peay said the Utah Republican Party needs to control its message We need to explain there is so much great economic opportunity here in Utah because for 40 years the Utah Republican Party has dominated state and local politics Peay said We need to educate people about that and help them understand that if we keep Utah Republican those same opportunities will still be here for our children and even our grandchildren Cox Henderson legislative leaders including House Speaker Brad Wilson and Senate President Stuart Adams and others endorsed Peay in a letter circulated to delegates mailed using the Utah Republican Party s indicia a service that s offered to all Utah GOP candidates for cheaper postage Peay said those endorsements show he knows how to build a team And that s what we plan to do he said along with his vice chairperson running mate Austin Cox He says he plans to do that with a unifying style The role of state party leadership is to build a bigger tent It s not to divide It s not to offend Rather it s to build a team and to get that team to coalesce around the ideas and values of the Republican Party Carson Jorgensen Jorgensen 31 of Mount Pleasant in Sanpete County is a sixth generation sheep rancher in a family that s lived in Utah for more than 150 years he said His family businesses are Skyline Sheep Co as well as Skyline Bit and Spur a small business that ships horse bridles and silver Carson Jorgensen Carson Jorgensen His family s heritage Jorgensen said tells the story of why this race is important to me We rely heavily on public lands he said describing how the sheep industry helped build Utah s infrastructure So that s why he s getting involved in politics he said Unfortunately politics shapes a lot of these things he said Politics is getting increasingly militant around agriculture and if we don t start taking a key role in policy agriculture is going to be one that is going to lose out big time especially here in Utah where 75 of the state is federal land and most of it is used for agriculture Jorgensen pointed to Biden s 30 by 30 climate change policy and said it s going to drastically affect the agriculture sector here in Utah and it s going to ruin the legacy of my family So Jorgensen said he wants to get involved to save the future of agriculture and public lands in Utah I don t want to see the history of Utahns thrown under the bus for progressive policy he said It s not the first time Jorgensen has stepped into politics Last year he sent a letter to then Vice President Mike Pence members of Congress and others detailing the impacts to sheep ranching of the acquisition of a Colorado lamb processing facility which led to an investigation Jorgensen also ran an unsuccessful bid against Rep Chris Stewart last year On his campaign website Jorgensen discusses expanding the tent in Utah s GOP in order to attract new voters especially young voters He also prioritizes strengthening rural Utah including wildfire mitigation outdoor recreation water quality food supply chain and more to bridge the urban and rural divide Jorgensen also states Utah s GOP must tackle the issue of SB54 and strengthen the party s convention system Brad Baker Baker 22 a Weber State University student who lives in Sunset said one of the biggest reasons why he s decided to get involved is because he s sick of the mudslinging backstabbing that s gone on at the national level I firmly believe that s not what being a Republican is about Baker said I would argue it s something that both sides are guilty of and as such the biggest thing we need as a party but as the state of Utah as a whole is more unity and more hope for the future Baker acknowledges that he does not have as much political experience as his opponents but he argued he s the best equipped candidate to make the party more appealing to younger voters and therefore secure the party s future We also need to have more voices in the room from a wider variety of backgrounds a wider variety of life experiences because how goes the Republican Party so goes the state of Utah he said By voting for me the delegates would get a candidate who is emphasizing unity emphasizing greater diversity in encouraging people to run who might not otherwise Baker said he would expand the party s accessibility by modernizing the party s tactics through use of social media and technology make sure caucus nights are better advertised so younger Utahns would know how to get involved and consider moving caucus night to the weekend to help make it more accessible to those who work during the week

COVID 19 vaccination take up rate among seniors good but more can be done say experts SINGAPORE The take up rate of COVID 19 vaccination among seniors is acceptable or even good but more can be done to boost numbers infectious diseases experts said Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said earlier this month that about 60 per cent of eligible seniors aged 70 and above have received the COVID 19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments while the corresponding proportion for eligible seniors aged 60 to 69 is close to 70 per cent Infectious diseases experts said that the proportion is good especially in comparison to the take up rate of the influenza vaccination which they said is the most comparable to the COVID 19 vaccination I think it s an acceptable figure If you look at the influenza vaccination which has been promoted annually we don t even achieve 15 to 20 per cent so this is actually very good said infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital Dr Leong Hoe Nam When asked if the better take up for the COVID 19 vaccination is because it is potentially fatal he said that the flu can also be fatal taking the lives of 200 out of every 100 000 people aged 70 and above annually in Singapore Influenza can trigger heart attack and stroke he explained READ COVID 19 vaccination for seniors aged 70 and above begins in Singapore Professor Paul Tambyah president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection said that the take up rate among seniors is really good Flu is also known to be fatal in elderly people In fact it s probably comparable fatality rate with COVID 19 especially among the very old he said However experts said there is a need for more seniors to be vaccinated We want vaccine uptake to be as high as possible said Dr Hannah Clapham Assistant Professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health There are two reasons for wanting a high level of vaccination so that people are protected from COVID 19 and to boost population immunity For the senior group the first reason is very important as if people in this group become infected they have a high risk of severe disease she said READ COVID 19 vaccination for people aged 60 to 69 brought forward invitations to go out in next few days MOH People should get vaccinated so that as a whole as a country we can boost our population based immunity and as a result of that we may be able to inch towards normalcy said Dr Ling Li Min an infectious diseases physician at Rophi Clinic WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ENCOURAGE SENIORS Such health and community benefits are among the explanations Silver Generation Office SGO volunteer Vesuvasam Perianar gives to seniors when he goes door to door to engage them SGO the outreach arm of the Agency for Integrated Care has been engaging seniors since February this year with the help of about 3 000 volunteers Our main job is to ask them if they have received the letters If they have and have not made the appointment we will ask them why they have not made the appointment the 66 year old told CNA If seniors indicate that they need help in booking a slot Mr Perianar will help them on the spot In most cases they will say my children will help but they haven t had time they will do it in a short while maybe a few days later he said Others may be waiting for their next medical appointment in a month or two with their regular doctors to make sure that the vaccination is safe for them he added Information on their plans to register for a slot goes into a report he has to create at the end of these sessions Mr Perianar said Based on the report a volunteer not necessarily him will then go back to the home to get an update on the status of the booking Mr Perianar does these engagements with a partner four times a week for about two hours each time READ Government plans to invite people below the age of 45 to book COVID 19 vaccination slots from June SGO also arranges transport for seniors who are not able to get to a vaccination centre on their own he said Mr Perianar said that while the majority of the seniors he approaches would say that they would be booking an appointment or need help doing so about 20 per cent of them would be sceptical or distrustful of the vaccination regime To convince seniors he tells them that they may not be able to travel overseas even for religious pilgrimage without the vaccination He also uses himself as an example of someone who has had the vaccination He said Sometimes after we speak for a while they will be more open They will say ok lah I ll consider lah Still some of them are very adverse calling the regime a government gimmick and refusing to accept a leaflet containing more information he said He said that some of them bring up negative news about vaccination and have fears of overdosing or deaths that they misunderstand that have happened because of the vaccination BARRIERS TO VACCINATION Dr Leong said individuals have different reasons for not wanting to get the vaccination There are many elderly people whom I have spoken to who say I m not afraid of COVID 19 In fact if I die so be it I m not afraid of dying he said Barriers to seniors getting vaccinated could include mobility logistics and understanding of the vaccination said Dr Ling They seniors may at times listen to their friends more than what is on the mainstream media Sometimes older folks they could have more inertia to get themselves vaccinated she said Some of them may not feel the need to get the vaccination especially if community numbers are low and they don t go out so much she added Dr Clarence Tam Assistant Professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said that findings from a survey he recently conducted with his team suggest that many people are taking a wait and see approach They are unsure if the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks of side effects particularly given that the risk of contracting COVID 19 is currently low said Dr Tam The survey which has not been published was conducted online earlier this month among 1 000 Singapore residents aged 21 and above Findings were similar among seniors and other groups he added WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE TAKE UP AMONG SENIORS When asked what would make them more willing to get vaccinated respondents commonly mentioned personal recommendations from healthcare professionals family employers friends and the Government said Dr Tam For a third of respondents a strong motivator would be the relaxation of social distancing rules if many people are vaccinated he added Seeing positive stories on social media from people who had been vaccinated would also make them willing Dr Tam said In contrast people would be put off vaccination if a family member had a bad reaction to the vaccine if friends or family advised against vaccination or if they saw content on social media advising against vaccination he said Positive reinforcement and prompts from a broad range of trusted sources will be needed to encourage undecided individuals to get vaccinated he said adding that healthcare professionals have an important role to play particularly in allaying worries about side effects Dr Leong who said that Singapore should increase the proportion of vaccinated seniors by 10 per cent said that videos of elderly public figures getting vaccinated could help The narrative used to convince the elderly should revolve around helping their families he said It could be someone saying I am a grandmother I am 70 years old I am getting myself vaccinated because of my grandchildren he said Another way is to regularly organise trips to vaccination centres for seniors ferrying five seniors at a go What we have to do is literally take the mountain to Muhammad he said However Dr Leong said that he expects many seniors who have not been vaccinated to be immobile and that they may not account for much in overall herd immunity Individuals who are mobile interacting in public areas are more important in the calculation of herd immunity These individuals tend to be more well informed a bit on the younger side of 70 and they would be interacting with their peers he said BOOKMARK THIS Our comprehensive coverage of the coronavirus outbreak and its developments Download our app or subscribe to our

First observation These words of the general secretary are not just to say one time and one place In the past few days General Secretary Xi Jinping visited Guangxi and gave important instructions on the construction of ecological civilization along the way Many golden sentences have been brushed off the screen At almost the same time the Central Ecological Environmental Protection Inspectorate in eight provinces and autonomous regions notified many typical cases of destroying the ecological environment It is thought provoking to link these two things together On the Lijiang River General Secretary Xi Jinping listened to a report on the comprehensive management of the river basin In recent years Guilin City has vigorously promoted the Lijiang River to quot control chaos water mountains and root causes quot to improve the ecological environment of the Lijiang River Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Hongshe general secretary emphasized The worst thing is quarrying If you destroy a mountain you will lose such a mountain forever The whole of China and the world is such a treasure Don t destroy it Central Ecological Environment Among the typical cases just exposed by the protection inspection team there are several cases of illegal quarrying and mining In some places illegal quarrying is still carried out in the World Geopark Reserve which has caused serious ecological damage This time the general secretary pointed out the quarrying problem straightforwardly which is very realistic for some places Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China whether it is for domestic investigations and investigations or attending international events wherever General Secretary Xi Jinping goes he has talked about the concept that green waters and green mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains However some phenomena that seriously damage the ecology and seriously pollute the environment are still exposed from time to time What is the problem behind this Some local leading cadres believe that the region has a good ecological background large environmental capacity a little sewage a little tree cut and a little project quot innocent quot and they lack understanding of the urgency of ecological environmental protection The concept of quot emphasizing development and neglecting protection quot of some local leading cadres has not been fundamentally reversed and the phenomenon that ecological environmental protection is quot important when it comes to it but secondary when it is done quot still occurs from time to time There are also historical reasons that some local leading cadres quot should the pot quot and the ability and level of governance to implement the new development concept still needs to be improved quot Any abuse of mining and digging requires not only accountability but also criminal responsibility in accordance with the law quot Regarding the chaos of quarrying the general secretary 39 s words were very serious and once again sounded the alarm for the ecological and environmental protection of various places In fact this is also the consistent attitude of the Party Central Committee towards ecological and environmental issues The illegal construction of villas in Qinling Mountains destroys the ecological environment General Secretary Xi Jinping has issued important instructions 6 times to solve the problems personally local ecological damage in the Qilian Mountains pollution incident in the Tengger Desert illegal filling of the Qiandao Lake Grasp the problem of destruction to the end There is a phenomenon that is particularly noteworthy In the past few days the Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspection Team has exposed many typical cases of blindly expanding production capacity and launching projects regardless of resource endowments Shanxi Jinzhong City has not approved the first construction and launched five large scale coking projects in violation of regulations Enterprises illegally discharged pollutants and competed with the people for water causing difficulties for nearby residents The construction of chemical and coal power projects in Guzhen County Anhui illegally started construction and the bottom line of regional environmental quality has been repeatedly breached posing a threat to the water ecological environment of the Huaihe River In the first year of the Fourth Five Year Plan after experiencing the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and facing the external environment of headwinds and currents the enthusiasm for development projects in some places began to swell and they wanted to pursue a quot good start quot The Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Supervisor is approved by the Party Central Committee At the beginning of the quot 14th Five Year Plan quot this inspection was organized and the strict control of high energy consuming and high emission projects was blindly launched as one of the inspection priorities which was very targeted Coincidentally 5 years ago the quot 13th Five Year Plan quot started Before that in 2015 China 39 s economic growth continued to slow down falling below 7 Some provinces and cities along the Yangtze River are gearing up for projects in the 13th Five Year Plan On January 5 2016 General Secretary Xi Jinping convened a symposium on promoting the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in Chongqing and he eloquently proposed to protect together and not to develop quot It seems to be a pot of cold water quot This symposium promptly cooled the development impulse of the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River and it was a reversal of the direction of economic development In the past five years the General Secretary hosted three symposiums around the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt to consolidate the path of ecological priority and green development Practice has proved that the joint efforts to protect the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River not only did not affect the development speed of the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River but also greatly enhanced the supporting and leading role of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in supporting the high quality development of the country Looking at the first year in five years getting started is critical The quot 14th Five Year Plan quot is a critical period and window period for carbon peaks Once the two highs project blindly launched it will not only damage the current ecological environment but also pose a severe challenge to the future carbon dioxide emission reduction and the achievement of carbon peak and carbon neutral commitments It is very necessary to press down on such signs from the beginning Combining this background

VELCAN HOLDINGS Annual results 2020 stable financial results but decrease of the net income t PRESS RELEASE Luxembourg 30 th April 2021 ANNUAL RESULTS 20 20 STABLE FINANCIAL RESULTS BUT DECREASE OF THE NET INCOME DUE TO DISAPPOINTING OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL AND INDIA NON AUDITED KEY CONSOLIDATED FIGURES 20 20 201 9 Var Revenues EUR m 2 5 2 8 12 EBITDA EUR m 2 0 1 4 4 5 Net Income EUR m 2 1 3 6 4 1 Shareholders Equity EUR m 1 16 1 21 4 Cash and Financial assets 10 5 103 1 closed 2020 with a net result Group share of EUR 2 1m compared to EUR 3 6m in 2019 This decline essentially stems from on one hand a drop of the Brazilian operational result due to a very low generation coupled with a massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency and on the other hand an increase of the impairment of the Indian projects leading to an overall decline of the result The EBITDA is also down by 45 EUR 2 0m in 2020 vs EUR 1 4 m in 2019 Net financial gains which amounted to EUR 7 7m were almost stable compared to EUR 8 1m in 2019 mostly because of the reallocation of the portfolio from corporate bonds to equity and commodities Shareholder s equity decreased by 4 mainly due to the share buyback programs executed in 2020 492 k shares bought back in 2020 for a total price of EUR 3 1m During 2020 the continued developing its hydropower concessions located in India 571 MW and operated its Rodeio Bonito hydropower plant 15 MW in Brazil The uncertainties and deadlocks of the Indian hydropower market remained as in 2019 and prevented progress of the projects leading to an additional provision or Eur 2 8 million 20 for FY 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 considering the previously booked provisions This additional provision was already accounted for in the 2020 half yearly results published in October 2020 The Rodeio Bonito plant generation was historically low 40 below the 2019 generation as a result of the severe draught in the south of Brazil which led to an increase of the payments to the MRE system 1 At constant foreign exchange rates the turnover has grown 18 thanks to the inflation of selling prices In Euro the turnover is down by 12 EUR 2 5 m in 2020 vs EUR 2 8 m in 2019 because of the massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency in 2020 41 FINANCIAL YEAR 20 20 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE BUSINESS India The hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the State of Arunachal Pradesh could not make significant progress due to several long lasting administrative and regulatory impediments aggravated by the Covid 19 pandemic The Techno Economic Clearance TEC Environmental Clearance Forest Clearance as well as most of the post TEC investigations being complete for the tandem Heo Tato 1 426 MW the main next development steps for these 2 projects are the land acquisition the transport infrastructure the amendment of the concession agreements the stage 2 Forest Clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable Power Purchase Agreement PPA These steps however essentially fall under the purview and responsibility of the State and Central Governments During 2020 the land acquisition procedure conducted by the State Government was halted due to a stoppage of the land survey by several land owners who physically prevented the District administration to enter some parts of the land complaining about land ownership disputes and claiming immediate financial compensations The discussions initiated between the state government and the concerned owners in February 2020 were suspended due to the Covid 19 outbreak as the required meetings could happen only physically The procedure could restart only in February 2021 All the on site surveys and boundary markings were completed by the in March 2021 without interruption As of the date of this press release the Group has not received the official survey report and list of land owners from the However the Group s team attended each survey and it is the Group understanding that significant parts of the land requirement have again been registered by the as being under ownership dispute and that the survey may lead to an increase of disputed areas as compared to earlier lists established by the State Government The Group does not know yet if and how the Government of Arunachal Pradesh GoAP will settle these disputes and find a solution that will allow permanent site access and the Projects implementation considers that as per the current concession agreement and applicable regulations the land acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the exclusive responsibility of the licensing Government The concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer Negotiations with the GoAP for the amendment of the concession agreement relate to the development timeframe but also to the amendment of the allocated capacities still 380MW in the current concession agreement and other important terms have not progressed since 2018 This has led to the impossibility to renew the TECs of the Heo and Tato 1 426 MW tandem in 2020 as such renewal required either a concession agreement up to date with the 426 MW capacity approved by CEA or a non objection certificate NOC from the GoAP TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP granted in 2015 for 3 years and already extended a first time in 2018 for 2 years were bearing validities until on 27 th July 2020 and 28 th October 2020 respectively Applications for renewals of both TECs were submitted to CEA which requested the Group to obtain from GoAP a NOC acknowledging that the GoAP has no objection to the renewal of the projects TECs for the current capacities of 240 MW and 186 MW After several discussions the GoAP refused on 1 st October 2020 to issue a NOC unless the concession agreements were amended under conditions entailing significant financial costs some of which the Group does not agree with After requesting a draft amendment to the GoAP during Q4 2020 without success the Group finally sent its own proposed draft amendment in Q1 2021 Its main provisions relate to the allocated installed capacities the administrative fees the development timeframe the obligations of both parties and the increase of the free power to the GoAP against the withdrawal of its potential equity participation in the projects The provisions have been proposed by the Group considering the historical difficulties and the ground reality of the projects and of the Indian hydropower market As of the date of this press release the discussions are going on with the GoAP but both TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP are technically not valid anymore and their renewal is depending on the execution of the revised concession agreement in addition to the CEA renewal procedure The road infrastructures have kept progressing at a slow pace during 2020 as they did in previous years No progress has been made by the regarding the acceleration of the overall completion schedule The scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade up to the projects site are still scheduled theoretically in 2022 but will most likely face significant delays of 2 to 3 years given that for some stretches the technical studies have not yet even been completed On the forest clearance side the renewal of the stage I clearance has been applied for in September 2020 and is still under progress as of date The Group continued to explore the Indian market and to conduct its preliminary search for a PPA during 2020 All the major Indian power traders PPA brokers and distribution companies DISCOMS contacted for Heo and Tato 1 either declined to take up a commercial discussion for a PPA or did not respond The continued lack of appetite of the market for hydropower PPAs results from the commercial and financial Indian market conditions which remained the same during 2020 and still do not fulfil the requirements for the long term and bankable sale of hydropower The market remained constrained by the lack of appropriate regulatory framework for such bankable PPAs the stressed financial position of electricity distribution companies DISCOMS and the indirect competition of cheap solar and wind power Grid stability and the requirement for peak power 2 have also become a growing issue for Run of the River ROR hence with no storage hydro projects such as Heo and Tato 1 HEPs Two years after the announcement of the new hydropower policy by the a first part of the long awaited implementation regulation has finally be issued imposing a Hydropower Purchase Obligation HPO on DISCOMS setting a percentage of power that shall be procured by them from hydropower sources between 2021 and 2030 These percentages range from 0 18 to 2 82 and are remarkably lower than those of solar power currently at 10 25 for 2021 The question is raised within the industry whether these provisions will be sufficient to trigger a general revival of the hydropower sector and enough demand for long term bankable PPAs for projects which are not yet under construction Despite the above issues the Group s projects are the only hydropower projects of such size in India owned and developed by a foreign investor They are amongst the most advanced private projects and present competitive techno economic and environmental features Despite long term promising prospects the current Indian power market and especially the hydropower sector are still characterized by a lot of uncertainties The Groups projects have been heavily delayed several years in a row These delays and uncertainties have been reflected in an additional provision of Eur 2 8 million 20 of gross value decided for first semester 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 of gross value considering the cumulated provisions booked in previous years EUR 4 4m or 30 of gross value The Indian projects activities have been detailed in chapter I 4 1 of the annual report available at Brazil The Rodeio Bonito Hydropower plant 15 MW recorded a historically low production of 29 496 MWh in 2020 40 below the 2019 generation 49 113 MWh in 2019 and close to its all time record low of 2012 24 793 MWh However the turnover when expressed in the Brazilian currency BRL was up thanks to the inflation and the MRE system But as a result of this very low electricity generation and the national low hydro generation in 2020 the plant had to compensate the MRE system which was in a negative position This is why payments to the MRE were much higher reaching EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 As a result the EBITDA of the plant amounted to BRL 8 1m against BRL 9 3m in 2019 down by 13 When converted in euro the EBITDA of the plant was significantly lower to EUR 1 4m vs 2 1m in 2019 51 mostly due to a 34 depreciation of the average rate of the Brazilian Real vs Euro currency in 2020 Financial Assets also continued to manage actively its treasury throughout a complicated year marked by the Covid 19 pandemic and its impact on the financial markets The Group executed an important reallocation of its investments in other asset classes The Group started the year with a portfolio invested at approximately 60 in bonds mostly high yield corporate ones This bond portfolio was reduced by approximately half in January and February as the rewards seemed not any more commensurate with the potential default risks Since the March 2020 market crunch the Group has gradually changed its asset allocation to include more exposure to equity and commodities mostly gold As of 31 st December 2020 the bonds exposure including T bills was reduced to 19 of the portfolio 64 as of 31 12 19 whereas the rest of the portfolio of cash financial assets and financial liabilities EUR 104 5 m included a negative net cash position of EUR 9 3 m 9 of the portfolio versus a positive net debt position of EUR 27 2 m in 2019 25 of the portfolio 19 of gold related exposure versus 1 as of 31 12 2019 21 of oil related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 4 of silver related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 42 of equity excluding oil long positions 7 as of 31 12 2019 4 of equity short positions 2 in 2019 1 in private equity and credit 3 in 2019 While reallocating its financial assets towards equity the Group has invested in companies which were trading at historically low prices and could benefit from the improvement of the Covid 19 situation The two sectors hence selected were banking and energy This strategy of reallocation of the financial assets proved profitable as the Group net financial assets rose from Eur 103 million to Eur 105 million and the financial result amounted to EUR 7 7 m as of 31 12 2020 stable when compared to 2019 EUR 8 1 m and despite the COVID 19 crisis Given the current very low levels of benchmark rates in all developed markets USA Europe and Japan the Group does not anticipate it will increase again its investments in corporate bonds in the medium term The Group has reduced significantly its financial exposure to the USD and increased its exposure to the Euro and the Japanese Yen As of 31 12 2020 the Group financial assets were exposed notably to the US Dollars 35 against 67 in 2019 the Japanese Yen 25 against 2 in 2019 and the Euro 22 against 9 in 2019 It is to be noted that the Gold and Silver positions are priced in USD and as such are included in the former USD exposure Contrary to the previous years the Group has fully invested its cash and has used some leverage see above net cash position The financial portfolio is detailed in part I section 3 1 B of the annual report 2020 available at During the year continued to execute buyback programs in order to provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to sell their shares The shares are bought back in view of their cancellation or to cover for new grants of free shares A total of 492 348 shares were bought back in 2020 for a total price of Eur 3 131 696 275 000 shares were cancelled in April 2020 and as of 31 st December 2020 held 314 023 own shares representing 5 66 of its share capital Foreseeable evolution of the Group After the closing of this financial year the Group is pursuing the following main objectives as a priority for FY 2021 Pursuing the development of the Indian hydropower projects On the short term executing the required amendment to the concession agreements of the Indian hydropower projects in order to secure the renewal of the TECs and the renewal of Forest clearances Continue the active management of its diversified financial investments The ability of the Group to pursue these objectives is subject to the evolution of the current Covid 19 crisis which may affect both the development of the Indian projects and the financial portfolio FINANCIAL YEAR 2020 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Statement unaudited consolidated Turnover amounted to EUR 2 5m against EUR 2 8m in 2018 a 12 decrease mainly from electricity sales in Brazil The turnover in local currency increased by 18 with the inflation on electricity sale prices However the depreciation of the Brazilian currency vs the Euro currency was responsible for a 34 decrease of the turnover in Euro The current operating result amounted to EUR 5 6m against 4 3m in 2019 Payments to the MRE Energy Reallocation Mechanism were EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 Depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets of Rodeio Bonito plant amounted to EUR 0 5m EUR 0 7m in 2019 while depreciation on intangible projects under development was EUR 2 8 vs an amount of EUR 2 2m in 2019 due to the provision passed on Indian projects Staff expenses amounted to EUR 2 7m in 2020 vs EUR 2 6m in 2019 The Group employed on average 20 permanent employees in 2020 External expenses are totaling EUR 1 4m in 2020 vs EUR 1 5m in 2019 Net Financial Gain for the group amounted to EUR 7 7m in 2020 mostly because of the reallocation strategy from bonds to equity and commodities markets and despite the USD depreciation 9 compared to end of 2019 and its impact on the Group s cash and financial assets position The impact of this depreciation has been managed by the currency reallocation strategy of the Group avoiding bigger potential forex losses see breakdown per currency in chapter I 7 4 of the annual report This gain of 7 7m compares to EUR 8 1m in 2019 In 2020 other operating income EUR 0 2m consisted mainly of earn out gains on Brazilian assets related to Brazilian assets divested in previous years This figure was NIL in 2019 Income tax expense amounted to EUR 0 2m in 2020 same as in 2019 The net result Group share was EUR 2 1m in 2020 FY compared to EUR 3 6m in 2019 The Group s EBITDA reached EUR 2 0m compared to EUR 1 4m in 2019 The strong depreciation of BRL 41 and INR Indian Currency 12 closing rates when compared to Euro at 2020 closing date has heavily and negatively impacted the other comprehensive income as the Group s main tangible and intangible investments have been done in local currency EUR 4 5m in 2020 against EUR 0 1m in 2019 The total comprehensive income amounts to a loss of EUR 2 4m in 2020 against a gain of EUR 3 5m in 2019 Balance sheet Assets unaudited consolidated Net intangible assets stands at 8 3m in 2020 and are down by EUR 3 7m versus 2019 mostly because of the provision of EUR 2 8m of Indian assets the depreciation of the Indian currency EUR 0 9m and the Brazilian currency EUR 0 5m despite the addition of EUR 0 7m of capitalized costs on Indian projects Net tangible assets stands at 5 3m in 2020 and decreased by EUR 2 7m between 2019 and 2020 mainly because of depreciation of the Rodeio Bonito plant EUR 0 5m and the depreciation of the Brazilian currency EUR 2 3m Cash cash equivalent assets and financial assets net of Current financial liabilities have increased from EUR 103m in 2019 to EUR 105m in 2020 1 mainly thanks the good performance of the Group s financial portfolio and despite the share buyback programs Financial assets consist mainly in listed equity bonds and commodities related stocks Finally total assets increased by 15 3 during 2020 FY up by EUR 18 9 m mostly because of the bank overdraft facility described in below as part of the liabilities and the related asset purchases At 31 st December 2020 the Group and its subsidiaries holds 314 023 own shares 2019 146 810 At year end closing price of EUR 6 41 those own shares have a market value of EUR 2 0m Balance sheet Liabilities unaudited consolidated Non current provisions and other non current liabilities amount to EUR 0 7m and EUR 1 0m at 31 December 2020 respectively and arise from litigations related to the 2 biomass plants previously owned by the Group Satyamaharshi SMPCL 7 5 MW and Rithwik RPPL 7 5 MW owned between 2006 and 2010 The existing provision represents the major part of the claims as well as accumulated interests and judicial expenses Trade and other payables amount to EUR 0 9 m vs EUR 0 5m in 2019 due to EUR 0 3 m of payable related to MRE payments in Brazil due in early 2021 but related to 2020 generation Current financial liabilities of EUR 23 9 m in 2020 vs NIL in 2019 are related to overdraft facilities granted by a brokerage firm to the Group to leverage its listed investments trading activities Under this facility securities held in the trading account are used as a security to borrow money This facility has enabled the Group to leverage its investments and maximize its profits But it is to be noted that leverage works both ways and could also cause higher losses in case of fall in market prices Own shares booked directly against the equity of the Group at their historical cost reduce the net shareholder s equity of the Group by EUR 2 1m at 31 st December 2020 versus EUR 1 2m at 31 st December 2019 following the share buyback programs EUR 3 1m the capital reduction EUR 1 9m and the use of shares to cover share based payments EUR 0 4m As at 31 st December 2020 unrealized losses on conversion reserves booked directly against the equity amounted to EUR 14 2m versus an unrealized loss of

Silver too if it isn t tarnished Copper is just cheaper

Ransomware explained No silver bullet crooks out of reach BOSTON Political hand wringing in Washington over Russia s hacking of federal agencies and interference in US politics has mostly overshadowed a worsening digital scourge with a far broader wallop crippling and dispiriting extortionary ransomware attacks by cybercriminal mafias that mostly operate in foreign safe havens out of the reach of Western law enforcement Stricken in the United States alone last year were more than 100 federal state and municipal agencies upwards of 500 health care centers 1 680 educational institutions and untold thousands of businesses according to the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft Dollar losses are in the tens of billions Accurate numbers are elusive Many victims shun reporting fearing the reputational blight All the while ransomware gangsters have become more brazen and cocky as they put more and more lives and livelihoods at risk This week one syndicate threatened to make available to local criminal gangs data they say they stole from the Washington D C metro police on informants Another recently offered to share data purloined from corporate victims with Wall Street inside traders Cybercriminals have even reached out directly to people whose personal info was harvested from third parties to pressure victims to pay up In general the ransomware actors have gotten more bold and more ruthless said Allan Liska an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future On April 29 a public private task force including Microsoft Amazon the National Governors Association the FBI Secret Service and Britain and Canada s elite crime agencies delivered to the White House an 81 page urgent action plan for an aggressive and comprehensive whole of government assault on ransomware At the report s online launch Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a pre recorded video that the White House is developing a plan for disrupting ransomware and his department will work to implement many of the panel s recommendations because one thing is clear Ransomware is a threat to our national security Mayorkas last month announced a DHS ransomware initiative and the Department of Justice has just created a task force to tackle the scourge Where did ransomware come from How does it work The criminal syndicates that dominate the ransomware business are mostly Russian speaking and operate with near impunity out of Russia and allied countries They are a continuation and refinement ransomware was barely a blip three years ago of more than two decades of cyber thieving that spammed stole credit cards and identities and emptied bank accounts The syndicates have grown in sophistication and skill leveraging dark web forums to organise and recruit while hiding their identities and movements with tools like the Tor browser and cryptocurrencies that make payments and their laundering harder to track Ransomware scrambles a victim organisation s data with encryption The criminals leave instructions on infected computers for how to negotiate ransom payments and once paid provide software decryption keys Last year ransomware crooks expanded into data theft blackmail Before triggering encryption they quietly exfiltrate sensitive files and threaten to expose them publicly unless ransoms are paid Victims who diligently backed up their networks as a hedge against ransomware now had to think twice about refusing to pay At the end of 2019 only one ransomware group had an extortion site online that would publish such files Now more than two dozen do Victims who refuse to pay can incur costs that far exceed the ransoms they might have negotiated It happened recently to the University of Vermont Health Network It suffered an estimated US 1 5mil a day in losses in the two months it took to recover More than 5 000 hospital computers their data scrambled into gibberish had to be wiped clean and reconstituted from backed up data The University of California San Francisco heavily involved in Covid 19 research barely hesitated before paying It gave the criminals US 1 1mil last June Manufacturers have been especially hard hit this year with ransoms of US 50mil demanded of computer makers Acer and Quanta a major supplier of Apple laptops How are these criminals organised Some top ransomware criminals fancy themselves software service professionals They take pride in their customer service providing help desks that assist paying victims in file decryption And they tend to keep their word They have brands to protect after all If they stick to their promises future victims will be encouraged to pay up Maurits Lucas director of intelligence solutions at the cybersecurity firm Intel471 told a webinar earlier this year As a victim you actually know their reputation The business tends to be compartmentalised An affiliate will identify map out and infect targets choose victims and deploy ransomware that is typically rented from a ransomware as a service provider The provider gets a cut of the payout the affiliate normally taking more than three quarters Other subcontractors may also get a slice That can include the authors of the malware used to break into victim networks and the people running the so called bulletproof domains behind which the ransomware gangs hide their command and control servers Those servers manage the remote sowing of malware and data extraction ahead of activation a stealthy process that can take weeks Why do ransoms keep climbing How can they be stopped In Thursday s report the task force says it would be wrong to try to ban ransom payments largely because ransomware attackers continue to find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack The task force recognises that paying up can be the only way for an afflicted business to avoid bankruptcy Worse the sophisticated cybercriminals often have done their research and know a victim s cybersecurity insurance coverage limit They ve been known to mention it in negotiations That degree of criminal savvy helped drive average ransom payments to more than US 310 000 last year up 171 from 2019 according to Palo Alto Networks a task force member Not surprisingly the still young cyber insurance industry is reeling Premiums have gone up by 50 to 100 in the past year as ransomware became the No 1 claim said Michael Phillips chief claims officer of Resilience Insurance and a co chair of the task force On average cyber insurance claim payouts can now exceed 70 of what is paid in premiums prompting some insurers to drop this type of insurance altogether industry reports show The multi pronged response to ransomware proposed by the task force will require the kind of concerted diplomatic legal and law enforcement cooperation with key allies that the Trump administration shunned displacing what the authors call the current uncoordinated disjointed response There is no silver bullet but if we re going to shift the trajectory of this type of attack the US government has got to get at this with some speed said task force co chair Philip Reiner CEO of the nonprofit Institute for Security and Technology Ransomware developers and their affiliates should be named and shamed they are not always easy to identify and regimes that enable them punished with sanctions the report urges It calls for mandatory disclosure of ransom payments and a federal response fund to provide financial assistance to victims in hopes that in many cases it will prevent them from paying ransoms And it wants stricter regulation of cryptocurrency markets to make it more difficult for criminals to launder ransomware proceeds The task force also calls for something potentially controversial

Super Soco s CPx super scooter Going electric for a germ free commute Sales of electric motorcycles are big news for the bike industry latest figures show that March registrations in this sector this year are up by 151 per cent over the same month in 2020 while nearly half of all new low powered scooters are now battery powered Could it be because commuters post Covid are fearful of rubbing shoulders with strangers on public transport because it s easier to filter past caused by the spread of emergency LTNs or because they re fun relatively inexpensive to run and friendly It s probably a mix of all three but to find what all the fuss is about I jumped on one of the latest new machines the CPx super scooter from Super Soco who claim it s similar in performance to a 125cc two wheeler Attractively styled the CPx comes either with one battery offering a claimed range of 44 miles or two offering a claimed range of 87 miles The price difference between the two is significant with the single battery model costing 3 599 after taking the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles grant into consideration and the dual battery model costing 4 699 demonstrating just how pricey battery technology still is The CPx comes in black grey or silver and is backed by a two year warranty for the vehicle three for the battery It can be ridden on an A1 licence requiring training after which if you pass the various test levels you will be entitled to carry a pillion and ride on the motorway although I wouldn t recommend that on the CPx with its limited top speed The Super Soco is reasonably well equipped with a smart clear LCD display reasonably good build quality a big comfy thought slightly too high squashy seat a tall clear protective screen very decent rear view mirrors a useful parcel rack a side stand as well as centre stand and even a reverse mode useful perhaps for getting out of tight front garden parking spaces It is of course eerily quiet once you turn the key and all it requires to get moving there s no clutch or gears is a twist of the throttle which sees the bike spring to life and surge forward thanks to its 4 8Kw 5hp hub mounted electric motor In London traffic it kept up nicely with other vehicles from a standing start in fact its forte is leaping smartly away from traffic lights Acceleration is reasonably swift and progressive at least when the batteries are well charged during our brief assessment they didn t drop below 80 per cent right up to the claimed top speed of around 55mph The brakes both operated by hand controls as with a bicycle worked firmly and effectively and the steering was sufficiently quick to make filtering around other traffic very efficient indeed It also felt grippy on the road in bends despite having fairly narrow tyres although we didn t ride it in the wet Compared to the more basic model launched by Super Soco and reviewed here in 2017 the CPx is far more advanced Thanks to the 16 inch front wheel the CPx felt stable and well able to cope with lumps and bumps in the road at least at the front end At the rear where there s a smaller 14 inch rear wheel the CPx s ability to soak up bumps was more limited you need to slow down for sharper edged ramps to avoid a jolt through the seat The CPx was very easy to push into and out of parking spaces important in London stable when parked on its side stand and easy to hoist onto its equally stable centre stand Despite its rakish looks there s not much in the way of luxury it s a scooter after all but there s a small hidey hole large enough for a phone though I wouldn t advise it it might bounce out in the leg shields next to a hook useful perhaps for carrying take aways or small shopping bags There s also a USB socket for charging purposes a built in alarm decent sized pillion foot pegs and an ignition operated steering lock The batteries live under the hinged seat and can be charged from a standard household plug in situ or easily detached and carried indoors to be plugged in They are heavy mind at nearly 20kgs each You wouldn t want to carry them far Likes The CPx is a cinch to ride very quiet and unless you count the fumes going up the electric power station chimney very clean It s also stable and vicious speed bumps aside comfy Dislikes The otherwise effective screen felt perilously close to my face I d prefer it to have been angled further away for safety The seat is high and broad on account of the size of the batteries so will put shorter riders off I would also have preferred more built in stowage but there really isn t room If it was mine I d invest in a small top box fitted to the rack So who s going to buy it You could find a new petrol powered scooter for less but that of course would cause more pollution and wouldn t give you the same electric environmental feel good factor while through London It will appeal to those who like the easy unintimidating approachable nature of an electric scooter and to those for whom environmental issues are paramount Crucially it is also according to figures supplied by Super Soco considerably cheaper to run than a petrol model It s worth noting however that according to motorcycle bible MCN which conducted extensive tests performance on the CPx can drop off as the batteries charge level goes down They also said they were able to achieve an 80 mile range with two batteries but only by remaining under 30mph no problem in London Super Soco s own sums show that an average 125cc petrol scooter costs 5p per mile to run compared to just 1p for the CPx Over a year for a typical 23 mile round commute over 256 working days a year that amounts to a cost of 294 40 for a petrol scooter or a winning 58 88 for the CPx There s the added convenience of not having to stop at petrol stations Charging the batteries instead they say takes 3 4 hours and can be done at home or the office A petrol scooter costs 25 a year to tax while the keeper of an electric scooter pays nothing Maintenance is also far less of an issue for electric bikes as there are fewer moving parts If the CPx s battery should ever need replacing outside warranty however it s hardly cheap at over 1 800 So there you have it a clean quiet guilt free new tech solution to commuting around London post Covid while avoiding all those potentially germy commuters on the bus and tube More

Great Green Wall promises better lives to African farmers By Richard Wetaya Once complete it will reportedly be the largest living structure on the planet covering an area 8 000 km long by 17 km wide three times the size of the Great Barrier Reef and stretching across the entire continent With the fresh infusion of funds obtained at the Paris One Planet Summit for Biodiversity it is anticipated that hard pressed pastoral and agricultural communities long challenged by poverty and persistent food insecurity in the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions will enjoy better lives Diarra Fatoumata a 38 year old mother of four is from one of those farming communities Koremairwa village in the Doutchi District of southwestern Niger She is one of many smallholder farmers who recently received improved millet and maize seeds courtesy of the initiative My farming prospects have gotten better on account of using improved grain seeds she said recently She elaborated Previously some of the seeds I used to plant would germinate but the crops would wither and die off With the new seeds I am now able to produce and harvest sturdier crops which have a better market value Together with other smallholder farmers from my village and other areas of the Sahel we have also attained training on appropriate crop rotation and how to use small scale irrigation for crop production and for extending farming activities into the dry season For good measure a number of smallholder farmers in Sudan Eritrea Ethiopia and Djibouti were also trained in proper agroforestry water harvesting and irrigation practices and on how to create shelterbelts for their farmlands Shelterbelts are now helping many farmers in controlling soil erosion in Sudan said Abdel Aldai a wheat and maize farmer in Karima Sudan He added With agroforestry we were taught how to integrate trees which are helpful in climate change mitigation into our farming activities with an aim of achieving better productivity by tapping into the ecosystem amenities supplied by trees Agricultural and environment policy analysts reckon that the additional funding vouchsafed by the French government the African Development Bank the World Bank the European Commission and other sources will breathe new life into the initiative The initiative has just under a decade to achieve its goals of creating 10 million green jobs sequestering 250 million tonnes of carbon restoring 100 million hectares of degraded land and protecting Africa s biodiversity while reducing poverty and food insecurity Its mediocre progress to date was highlighted in a United Nations status report Great Green Wall Implementation Status and Way Ahead to 2030 released last year The report found that the though the initiative was more than halfway to its 2030 completion date it had only covered 4 per cent of its target area The findings did make for good reading in some African ecological and environmental research think tank circles For some it was an indictment on the people in charge of the initiative said Faustin Banjoko a climate action and development policy expert He added It also lent credence to schools of thought that held that zero net degradation and dryland tree planting afforestation in the 7 million square kilometers Sahel region would face long odds as had been the case with the North African Green Dam project By all accounts however the initiative s execution shortfalls were due to deficiencies in funding and technical support Now those obstacles seem to be out of the way Godfrey Oluka an environment specialist at the United Nations Development Programme said the new funding in a year that marks the beginning of the UN s Decade for Ecosystem Restoration may just be the silver lining the initiative needed It is a welcome development It will hopefully draw forth a renewed urgency in executing the initiative s targets that is the restoration of degraded land in the Sahel a region that experiences a 3 per cent decline in agricultural production per year due to land degradation The region has in the last 30 years been devastated by severe drought and massive loss of fertile land due to climate change and over farming and the enhancement of agricultural production systems in the rest of the Great Green Wall GGW intervention zones represented by Ethiopia Eritrea Mauritania and Djibouti Oluka said Banjoko elaborated On the face of it there is a lot of progress being made in the GGW nations especially in the areas of promoting agroforestry improving livestock breeding providing green jobs creating shelter belts for farmlands improving irrigation efficiency for agricultural production strengthening climate resilience and boosting pastoral and agro pastoral regenerative agricultural production These will in the course of time all translate into better incomes and a better food security status quo Because crop production in the Sahel is for the most part rain fed with limited irrigated agriculture several smallholding traditional agriculture farmers in countries like Niger Burkina Faso and Mali have been getting apprenticeships on the improved use of sprinkle and drip surface irrigation techniques and on proper rainwater harvesting practices There was further good news for farmers when the Green Climate Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development recently announced that they had a pipeline investment project called the Great Green Wall Umbrella Programme GGW Up It would ostensibly boost climate finance for the GGW nation s rural populations and would ensure that small scale farmers and agribusinesses have better access to markets and strengthened value chains creating economic opportunities and jobs through the development of climate resilient infrastructure and expanding the use of solar energy Speaking at the One Planet Summit Susan Gardner director of the UN s Environment Programme s Ecosystems Division said the initiative was an inspiring example of ecosystem restoration in action This initiative alone will not transform the Sahel s fortunes overnight but will rapidly become a green growth corridor that will bring investment boost food security create jobs and sow the seeds of peace she noted In recent years however there have been growing concerns that the ongoing conflict in central Sahel would slow down progress particularly in Mali Burkina Faso and Niger There are already grim realities on the ground with statistics from the International Organisation for Migration s Displacement Tracking Matrix indicating that over 1 5 million people have been internally displaced by the ongoing crises in the three nations Notwithstanding that there are pointers to strides being made During a recent International Forest Day Forward Thinkers Webinar Louise Baker managing director of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification Global Mechanism said about 20 per cent of the project s target area has now been completed All partners are working assiduously towards the initiative s 2030 targets she said adding Eighteen million hectares of the proposed 100 million land hectares have been restored 350 000 green jobs out of the proposed 10 million have been created and about US 90 million generated by communities in the initiative s intervention zone On the green economy front the anticipation is that by the initiative s completion point 8 000 kilometers of the intervention zone s land area will be covered with a mosaic of trees and plants Thus far more than 5 million hectares of degraded land have been restored in Niger and 12 million trees planted in Senegal Some 15 million land hectares have been restored in Ethiopia 29 602 hectares in Burkina Faso 52 930 hectares in Eritrea and 120 hectares of land in Mali among other places According to the UN report land restoration in the project intervention zones positively impacted 15 of the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals SDGs By all accounts the US 90 million generated helped to reduce rural poverty in the intervention zones Baker is upbeat about the initiative s prospects This initiative will not come up short like previous tree planting ecological projects on the continent The difference is that it is owned and implemented by communities and countries themselves she said She added Each country has designated a protected area dedicated to activities along the Great Green Wall managed by their local communities A unique practice known as rainwater harvesting which collects the heavy annual rainfall and distributes it

Shi Jinyuan Gold and Silver Soaring and Falling Markets and Latest Price Trend Operation Suggestions Market trend analysis April 30 gold news analysis Thursday 4 29 gold technical today 39 s gold market is after the Asian market rushed higher and the entire European market fell so the current market day is considered to belong Weak but from the perspective of the trend yesterday 39 s price broke the high point of the rebound before the last decline in 1785 and there are signs of strengthening on the trend But the key support is the 1762 position If this position falls below then the whole trend will reverse and become a very weak movement However regardless of the trend in the case of intraday weakening because the US is a rebound before the market then the US The probability of a second dip after the market is relatively high If the US market drops twice and breaks the current low then it is a continuation of the short position Today 39 s US market operation is to consider rebounding and shorting The current pressure on the top of gold is 1779 1781 1783 which are 382 0 5 618 after the intraday high of 1798 fell and the high point of rebound after the first fall below 1780 in the European market is near 1782 And the support below is the 1766 position which is the starting point for the ascent of the 4 hour chart level yesterday and the low point of 1762 yesterday Gold today 39 s suggestion is to go short in the 1781 83 area stop loss at 1788 and target at 1773 Gold is currently uncertain whether the market trend is long or short After all after yesterday s rise today s retracement is greater If the retracement of this wave is lower than 1762 the next time it rises again then the market is on the high side Rising the next time if it breaks the high point of 1789 today then the 1800 will be at risk of breaking and if today s price retracement falls below the position of 1762 or after today s decline tomorrow will extend its downward trend to break the situation of 1762 then This is the reversal of the entire trend After falling below 1762 the decline may be very large in the 1730 1720 area This is the general expectation On the whole today 39 s gold short term operation ideas suggest that the callback is mainly long and the rebound short is supplemented The top focus is on the first line resistance of 1780 1785 and the short term below focuses on the first line support of 1740 1745

VELCAN HOLDINGS Annual results 2020 stable financial results but decrease of the net income t PRESS RELEASE Luxembourg 30 th April 2021 ANNUAL RESULTS 20 20 STABLE FINANCIAL RESULTS BUT DECREASE OF THE NET INCOME DUE TO DISAPPOINTING OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL AND INDIA NON AUDITED KEY CONSOLIDATED FIGURES 20 20 201 9 Var Revenues EUR m 2 5 2 8 12 EBITDA EUR m 2 0 1 4 4 5 Net Income EUR m 2 1 3 6 4 1 Shareholders Equity EUR m 1 16 1 21 4 Cash and Financial assets 10 5 103 1 closed 2020 with a net result Group share of EUR 2 1m compared to EUR 3 6m in 2019 This decline essentially stems from on one hand a drop of the Brazilian operational result due to a very low generation coupled with a massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency and on the other hand an increase of the impairment of the Indian projects leading to an overall decline of the result The EBITDA is also down by 45 EUR 2 0m in 2020 vs EUR 1 4 m in 2019 Net financial gains which amounted to EUR 7 7m were almost stable compared to EUR 8 1m in 2019 mostly because of the reallocation of the portfolio from corporate bonds to equity and commodities Shareholder s equity decreased by 4 mainly due to the share buyback programs executed in 2020 492 k shares bought back in 2020 for a total price of EUR 3 1m During 2020 the continued developing its hydropower concessions located in India 571 MW and operated its Rodeio Bonito hydropower plant 15 MW in Brazil The uncertainties and deadlocks of the Indian hydropower market remained as in 2019 and prevented progress of the projects leading to an additional provision or Eur 2 8 million 20 for FY 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 considering the previously booked provisions This additional provision was already accounted for in the 2020 half yearly results published in October 2020 The Rodeio Bonito plant generation was historically low 40 below the 2019 generation as a result of the severe draught in the south of Brazil which led to an increase of the payments to the MRE system 1 At constant foreign exchange rates the turnover has grown 18 thanks to the inflation of selling prices In Euro the turnover is down by 12 EUR 2 5 m in 2020 vs EUR 2 8 m in 2019 because of the massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency in 2020 41 FINANCIAL YEAR 20 20 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE BUSINESS India The hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the State of Arunachal Pradesh could not make significant progress due to several long lasting administrative and regulatory impediments aggravated by the Covid 19 pandemic The Techno Economic Clearance TEC Environmental Clearance Forest Clearance as well as most of the post TEC investigations being complete for the tandem Heo Tato 1 426 MW the main next development steps for these 2 projects are the land acquisition the transport infrastructure the amendment of the concession agreements the stage 2 Forest Clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable Power Purchase Agreement PPA These steps however essentially fall under the purview and responsibility of the State and Central Governments During 2020 the land acquisition procedure conducted by the State Government was halted due to a stoppage of the land survey by several land owners who physically prevented the District administration to enter some parts of the land complaining about land ownership disputes and claiming immediate financial compensations The discussions initiated between the state government and the concerned owners in February 2020 were suspended due to the Covid 19 outbreak as the required meetings could happen only physically The procedure could restart only in February 2021 All the on site surveys and boundary markings were completed by the in March 2021 without interruption As of the date of this press release the Group has not received the official survey report and list of land owners from the However the Group s team attended each survey and it is the Group understanding that significant parts of the land requirement have again been registered by the as being under ownership dispute and that the survey may lead to an increase of disputed areas as compared to earlier lists established by the State Government The Group does not know yet if and how the Government of Arunachal Pradesh GoAP will settle these disputes and find a solution that will allow permanent site access and the Projects implementation considers that as per the current concession agreement and applicable regulations the land acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the exclusive responsibility of the licensing Government The concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer Negotiations with the GoAP for the amendment of the concession agreement relate to the development timeframe but also to the amendment of the allocated capacities still 380MW in the current concession agreement and other important terms have not progressed since 2018 This has led to the impossibility to renew the TECs of the Heo and Tato 1 426 MW tandem in 2020 as such renewal required either a concession agreement up to date with the 426 MW capacity approved by CEA or a non objection certificate NOC from the GoAP TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP granted in 2015 for 3 years and already extended a first time in 2018 for 2 years were bearing validities until on 27 th July 2020 and 28 th October 2020 respectively Applications for renewals of both TECs were submitted to CEA which requested the Group to obtain from GoAP a NOC acknowledging that the GoAP has no objection to the renewal of the projects TECs for the current capacities of 240 MW and 186 MW After several discussions the GoAP refused on 1 st October 2020 to issue a NOC unless the concession agreements were amended under conditions entailing significant financial costs some of which the Group does not agree with After requesting a draft amendment to the GoAP during Q4 2020 without success the Group finally sent its own proposed draft amendment in Q1 2021 Its main provisions relate to the allocated installed capacities the administrative fees the development timeframe the obligations of both parties and the increase of the free power to the GoAP against the withdrawal of its potential equity participation in the projects The provisions have been proposed by the Group considering the historical difficulties and the ground reality of the projects and of the Indian hydropower market As of the date of this press release the discussions are going on with the GoAP but both TECs of Heo and Tato 1 HEP are technically not valid anymore and their renewal is depending on the execution of the revised concession agreement in addition to the CEA renewal procedure The road infrastructures have kept progressing at a slow pace during 2020 as they did in previous years No progress has been made by the regarding the acceleration of the overall completion schedule The scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade up to the projects site are still scheduled theoretically in 2022 but will most likely face significant delays of 2 to 3 years given that for some stretches the technical studies have not yet even been completed On the forest clearance side the renewal of the stage I clearance has been applied for in September 2020 and is still under progress as of date The Group continued to explore the Indian market and to conduct its preliminary search for a PPA during 2020 All the major Indian power traders PPA brokers and distribution companies DISCOMS contacted for Heo and Tato 1 either declined to take up a commercial discussion for a PPA or did not respond The continued lack of appetite of the market for hydropower PPAs results from the commercial and financial Indian market conditions which remained the same during 2020 and still do not fulfil the requirements for the long term and bankable sale of hydropower The market remained constrained by the lack of appropriate regulatory framework for such bankable PPAs the stressed financial position of electricity distribution companies DISCOMS and the indirect competition of cheap solar and wind power Grid stability and the requirement for peak power 2 have also become a growing issue for Run of the River ROR hence with no storage hydro projects such as Heo and Tato 1 HEPs Two years after the announcement of the new hydropower policy by the a first part of the long awaited implementation regulation has finally be issued imposing a Hydropower Purchase Obligation HPO on DISCOMS setting a percentage of power that shall be procured by them from hydropower sources between 2021 and 2030 These percentages range from 0 18 to 2 82 and are remarkably lower than those of solar power currently at 10 25 for 2021 The question is raised within the industry whether these provisions will be sufficient to trigger a general revival of the hydropower sector and enough demand for long term bankable PPAs for projects which are not yet under construction Despite the above issues the Group s projects are the only hydropower projects of such size in India owned and developed by a foreign investor They are amongst the most advanced private projects and present competitive techno economic and environmental features Despite long term promising prospects the current Indian power market and especially the hydropower sector are still characterized by a lot of uncertainties The Groups projects have been heavily delayed several years in a row These delays and uncertainties have been reflected in an additional provision of Eur 2 8 million 20 of gross value decided for first semester 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects This brought the total provision to Eur 7 1 million 50 of gross value considering the cumulated provisions booked in previous years EUR 4 4m or 30 of gross value The Indian projects activities have been detailed in chapter I 4 1 of the annual report available at Brazil The Rodeio Bonito Hydropower plant 15 MW recorded a historically low production of 29 496 MWh in 2020 40 below the 2019 generation 49 113 MWh in 2019 and close to its all time record low of 2012 24 793 MWh However the turnover when expressed in the Brazilian currency BRL was up thanks to the inflation and the MRE system But as a result of this very low electricity generation and the national low hydro generation in 2020 the plant had to compensate the MRE system which was in a negative position This is why payments to the MRE were much higher reaching EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 As a result the EBITDA of the plant amounted to BRL 8 1m against BRL 9 3m in 2019 down by 13 When converted in euro the EBITDA of the plant was significantly lower to EUR 1 4m vs 2 1m in 2019 51 mostly due to a 34 depreciation of the average rate of the Brazilian Real vs Euro currency in 2020 Financial Assets also continued to manage actively its treasury throughout a complicated year marked by the Covid 19 pandemic and its impact on the financial markets The Group executed an important reallocation of its investments in other asset classes The Group started the year with a portfolio invested at approximately 60 in bonds mostly high yield corporate ones This bond portfolio was reduced by approximately half in January and February as the rewards seemed not any more commensurate with the potential default risks Since the March 2020 market crunch the Group has gradually changed its asset allocation to include more exposure to equity and commodities mostly gold As of 31 st December 2020 the bonds exposure including T bills was reduced to 19 of the portfolio 64 as of 31 12 19 whereas the rest of the portfolio of cash financial assets and financial liabilities EUR 104 5 m included a negative net cash position of EUR 9 3 m 9 of the portfolio versus a positive net debt position of EUR 27 2 m in 2019 25 of the portfolio 19 of gold related exposure versus 1 as of 31 12 2019 21 of oil related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 4 of silver related stocks none as of 31 12 2019 42 of equity excluding oil long positions 7 as of 31 12 2019 4 of equity short positions 2 in 2019 1 in private equity and credit 3 in 2019 While reallocating its financial assets towards equity the Group has invested in companies which were trading at historically low prices and could benefit from the improvement of the Covid 19 situation The two sectors hence selected were banking and energy This strategy of reallocation of the financial assets proved profitable as the Group net financial assets rose from Eur 103 million to Eur 105 million and the financial result amounted to EUR 7 7 m as of 31 12 2020 stable when compared to 2019 EUR 8 1 m and despite the COVID 19 crisis Given the current very low levels of benchmark rates in all developed markets USA Europe and Japan the Group does not anticipate it will increase again its investments in corporate bonds in the medium term The Group has reduced significantly its financial exposure to the USD and increased its exposure to the Euro and the Japanese Yen As of 31 12 2020 the Group financial assets were exposed notably to the US Dollars 35 against 67 in 2019 the Japanese Yen 25 against 2 in 2019 and the Euro 22 against 9 in 2019 It is to be noted that the Gold and Silver positions are priced in USD and as such are included in the former USD exposure Contrary to the previous years the Group has fully invested its cash and has used some leverage see above net cash position The financial portfolio is detailed in part I section 3 1 B of the annual report 2020 available at During the year continued to execute buyback programs in order to provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to sell their shares The shares are bought back in view of their cancellation or to cover for new grants of free shares A total of 492 348 shares were bought back in 2020 for a total price of Eur 3 131 696 275 000 shares were cancelled in April 2020 and as of 31 st December 2020 held 314 023 own shares representing 5 66 of its share capital Foreseeable evolution of the Group After the closing of this financial year the Group is pursuing the following main objectives as a priority for FY 2021 Pursuing the development of the Indian hydropower projects On the short term executing the required amendment to the concession agreements of the Indian hydropower projects in order to secure the renewal of the TECs and the renewal of Forest clearances Continue the active management of its diversified financial investments The ability of the Group to pursue these objectives is subject to the evolution of the current Covid 19 crisis which may affect both the development of the Indian projects and the financial portfolio FINANCIAL YEAR 2020 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Statement unaudited consolidated Turnover amounted to EUR 2 5m against EUR 2 8m in 2018 a 12 decrease

currency was responsible for a 34 decrease of the turnover in Euro The current operating result amounted to EUR 5 6m against 4 3m in 2019 Payments to the MRE Energy Reallocation Mechanism were EUR 0 7m in 2020 vs EUR 0 2m in 2019 Depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets of Rodeio Bonito plant amounted to EUR 0 5m EUR 0 7m in 2019 while depreciation on intangible projects

average 20 permanent employees in 2020 External expenses are totaling EUR 1 4m in 2020 vs EUR 1 5m in 2019 Net Financial Gain for the group amounted to EUR 7 7m in 2020 mostly because of the reallocation strategy from bonds to equity and commodities markets and despite the USD depreciation 9 compared to end of 2019 and its impact on the Group s cash and financial assets position The impact of this depreciation has been managed by the currency reallocation strategy of the Group avoiding bigger potential forex losses see breakdown per currency in chapter I 7 4 of the annual report This gain of 7 7m compares to EUR 8 1m in 2019 In 2020 other operating income EUR 0 2m consisted mainly of earn out gains on Brazilian assets related to Brazilian assets divested in previous years

Indian projects Net tangible assets stands at 5 3m in 2020 and decreased by EUR 2 7m between 2019 and 2020 mainly because of depreciation of the Rodeio Bonito plant EUR 0 5m and the depreciation of the Brazilian currency EUR 2 3m Cash cash equivalent assets and financial assets net of Current financial liabilities have increased from EUR 103m in 2019 to EUR 105m in 2020 1 mainly thanks the good performance of the Group s financial portfolio and despite the share buyback programs Financial assets consist mainly in listed equity bonds and commodities related stocks Finally total assets increased by 15 3 during 2020 FY up by EUR 18 9 m mostly because of the bank overdraft facility described in below as part of the liabilities and the related asset purchases At 31 st December 2020 the

expenses Trade and other payables amount to EUR 0 9 m vs EUR 0 5m in 2019 due to EUR 0 3 m of payable related to MRE payments in Brazil due in early 2021 but related to 2020 generation Current financial liabilities of EUR 23 9 m in 2020 vs NIL in 2019 are related to overdraft facilities granted by a brokerage firm to the Group to leverage its listed investments trading activities Under this facility securities held in the trading account are used as a security to borrow money This facility has enabled the Group to leverage its investments and maximize its profits But it is to be noted that leverage works both ways and could also cause higher losses in case of fall in market prices Own shares booked directly against the equity of the Group at their historical cost reduce the net shareholder s equity of the Group by EUR 2 1m at 31 st December 2020 versus EUR 1 2m at 31 st December 2019 following the share buyback programs EUR 3 1m the capital reduction EUR 1 9m and the use of

Ransomware explained No silver bullet crooks out of reach BOSTON Political hand wringing in Washington over Russia s hacking of federal agencies and interference in US politics has mostly overshadowed a worsening digital scourge with a far broader wallop crippling and dispiriting extortionary ransomware attacks by cybercriminal mafias that mostly operate in foreign safe havens out of the reach of Western law enforcement Stricken in the United States alone last year were more than 100 federal state and municipal agencies upwards of 500 health care centers 1 680 educational institutions and untold thousands of businesses according to the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft Dollar losses are in the tens of billions Accurate numbers are elusive Many victims shun reporting fearing the reputational blight All the while ransomware gangsters have become more brazen and cocky as they put more and more lives and livelihoods at risk This week one syndicate threatened to make available to local criminal gangs data they say they stole from the Washington D C metro police on informants Another recently offered to share data purloined from corporate victims with Wall Street inside traders Cybercriminals have even reached out directly to people whose personal info was harvested from third parties to pressure victims to pay up In general the ransomware actors have gotten more bold and more ruthless said Allan Liska an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future On April 29 a public private task force including Microsoft Amazon the National Governors Association the FBI Secret Service and Britain and Canada s elite crime agencies delivered to the White House an 81 page urgent action plan for an aggressive and comprehensive whole of government assault on ransomware At the report s online launch Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a pre recorded video that the White House is developing a plan for disrupting ransomware and his department will work to implement many of the panel s recommendations because one thing is clear Ransomware is a threat to our national security Mayorkas last month announced a DHS ransomware initiative and the Department of Justice has just created a task force to tackle the scourge Where did ransomware come from How does it work The criminal syndicates that dominate the ransomware business are mostly Russian speaking and operate with near impunity out of Russia and allied countries They are a continuation and refinement ransomware was barely a blip three years ago of more than two decades of cyber thieving that spammed stole credit cards and identities and emptied bank accounts The syndicates have grown in sophistication and skill leveraging dark web forums to organise and recruit while hiding their identities and movements with tools like the Tor browser and cryptocurrencies that make payments and their laundering harder to track Ransomware scrambles a victim organisation s data with encryption The criminals leave instructions on infected computers for how to negotiate ransom payments and once paid provide software decryption keys Last year ransomware crooks expanded into data theft blackmail Before triggering encryption they quietly exfiltrate sensitive files and threaten to expose them publicly unless ransoms are paid Victims who diligently backed up their networks as a hedge against ransomware now had to think twice about refusing to pay At the end of 2019 only one ransomware group had an extortion site online that would publish such files Now more than two dozen do Victims who refuse to pay can incur costs that far exceed the ransoms they might have negotiated It happened recently to the University of Vermont Health Network It suffered an estimated US 1 5mil a day in losses in the two months it took to recover More than 5 000 hospital computers their data scrambled into gibberish had to be wiped clean and reconstituted from backed up data The University of California San Francisco heavily involved in Covid 19 research barely hesitated before paying It gave the criminals US 1 1mil last June Manufacturers have been especially hard hit this year with ransoms of US 50mil demanded of computer makers Acer and Quanta a major supplier of Apple laptops How are these criminals organised Some top ransomware criminals fancy themselves software service professionals They take pride in their customer service providing help desks that assist paying victims in file decryption And they tend to keep their word They have brands to protect after all If they stick to their promises future victims will be encouraged to pay up Maurits Lucas director of intelligence solutions at the cybersecurity firm Intel471 told a webinar earlier this year As a victim you actually know their reputation The business tends to be compartmentalised An affiliate will identify map out and infect targets choose victims and deploy ransomware that is typically rented from a ransomware as a service provider The provider gets a cut of the payout the affiliate normally taking more than three quarters Other subcontractors may also get a slice That can include the authors of the malware used to break into victim networks and the people running the so called bulletproof domains behind which the ransomware gangs hide their command and control servers Those servers manage the remote sowing of malware and data extraction ahead of activation a stealthy process that can take weeks Why do ransoms keep climbing How can they be stopped In Thursday s report the task force says it would be wrong to try to ban ransom payments largely because ransomware attackers continue to find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack The task force recognises that paying up can be the only way for an afflicted business to avoid bankruptcy Worse the sophisticated cybercriminals often have done their research and know a victim s cybersecurity insurance coverage limit They ve been known to mention it in negotiations That degree of criminal savvy helped drive average ransom payments to more than US 310 000 last year up 171 from 2019 according to Palo Alto Networks a task force member Not surprisingly the still young cyber insurance industry is reeling Premiums have gone up by 50 to 100 in the past year as ransomware became the No 1 claim said Michael Phillips chief claims officer of Resilience Insurance and a co chair of the task force On average cyber insurance claim payouts can now exceed 70 of what is paid in premiums prompting some insurers to drop this type of insurance altogether industry reports show The multi pronged response to ransomware proposed by the task force will require the kind of concerted diplomatic legal and law enforcement cooperation with key allies that the Trump administration shunned displacing what the authors call the current uncoordinated disjointed response There is no silver bullet but if we re going to shift the trajectory of this type of attack the US government has got to get at this with some speed said task force co chair Philip Reiner CEO of the nonprofit Institute for Security and Technology Ransomware developers and their affiliates should be named and shamed they are not always easy to identify and regimes that enable them punished with sanctions the report urges It calls for mandatory disclosure of ransom payments and a federal response fund to provide financial assistance to victims in hopes that in many cases it will prevent them from paying ransoms And it wants stricter regulation of cryptocurrency markets to make it more difficult for criminals to launder ransomware proceeds The task force also calls for something potentially controversial amending the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to let private industry actively block or limit online criminal activity including of botnets the networks of hijacked zombie computers that ransomware criminals use to sow infections The odds of successfully stifling ransomware are high the report s authors acknowledge The old adage that a cybercriminal only has to be lucky once while a defender has to be lucky every minute of every day has never been more true AP

Royalties Plc Trident or the Company Q1 2021 Activities Update Transformational Lithium Royalty Acquisition Fundraising Continued Strength in Commodities Trident Royalties Plc AIM TRR FSX 5KV is pleased to provide an update on its activities undertaken during the first quarter ended 31 March 2021 including Q1 royalty receipts HIGHLIGHTS Q1 saw a significant increase in battery metals exposure in conjunction with an oversubscribed equity financing Trident completed its most significant transaction to date with the acquisition of a 60 interest in a gross revenue royalty GRR over the Thacker Pass Project Thacker Pass for a total consideration of US 28 0 million comprising US 26 0 million in cash and US 2 0 million in new ordinary shares in Trident Thacker Pass contains the largest defined lithium Mineral Reserve in the United States A successful concurrent equity financing of approximately GBP20 7 million approximately US 28 8 million was conducted at no discount to the prevailing market price to execute the Thacker Pass lithium royalty transaction and strengthen the balance sheet Trident completed the Talga gold royalties transaction and shortly post quarter end completed the previously announced Pukaqaqa copper royalties transaction finalising the acquisition of these seven royalties and With a portfolio inclusive of copper iron ore gold and now lithium Trident is increasingly reflective of the broader global mining sector providing investors with an inflation hedge in the face of loose global monetary policy and direct exposure to a once in a generation energy revolution Q1 royalty payments totalling approximately US 451 314 from royalties over producing assets an increase of 55 over Q4 2020 Royalty Stream Q1 2021 Payment Cumulative Payments since Acquisition Koolyanobbing iron A 100 479 A 2 740 884 ore royalty 1 Mimbula copper royalty US 375 000 US 453 707 Mimbula copper royalty payment of US 375 000 based on the Minimum Payment Schedule MPS under the royalty agreement representing a significant increase over Q4 2020 Q1 2021 production saw 671 tonnes of copper sold an increase over Q4 2020 as the project continues to ramp up The MPS on the Mimbula copper royalty continues in 2021 US 375 000 per quarter in 2021 less any excess payments made above the MPS from previous quarters increasing to US 500 000 per quarter in 2022 and US 750 000 for the first two quarters of 2023 2 Koolyanobbing iron ore royalty payment of A 100 479 US 76 314 3 a decrease over Q4 2020 on higher received price but lower volumes from the royalty area Trident notes the average grade at Koolyanobbing has fallen from 59 to 57 Fe since 2H20 Recent unprecedented strength in the iron ore market particularly for low grade fines products may incentivise operators to opportunistically favour production from lower grade areas in the short term 4 Trident s royalty covers a substantial portion of the Deception pit the highest grade deposit and a significant proportion of the total Koolyanobbing reserves Trident anticipates deferred production of this higher quality ore will benefit the Company in the short medium term Trident also notes the recent strategy overview presentation by Mineral Resources Limited the project operator which highlighted the impending finalisation of a 10 year plan for the Yilgarn Hub of which Koolyanobbing and its associated infrastructure is the central component Additionally Mineral Resources flagged the expansion of the Yilgarn Hub to 12Mtpa as a further growth opportunity and Commodity prices underlying Trident s royalty portfolio remained strong throughout Q1 2021 with iron ore averaging US 131 tonne copper averaging 8 503 tonne lithium carbonate equivalent LCE averaging US 9 083 tonne and gold averaging US 1 793 oz 5 Post quarter end copper has continued to climb to near 10 year highs while LCE prices have now doubled year to date to over US 13 500 tonne Q1 royalty portfolio growth combined with positive asset level progress by project operators Thacker Pass Lithium Project 6 In January 2021 Lithium Americas Corp LAC the project operator announced the receipt of the final key federal permit for the project followed shortly thereafter by a US 400 million equity fundraise primarily to fund the commencement of construction With the acquisition of 60 of the GRR Trident now has exposure to a key global lithium asset with a clear pathway to production Other highlights include Thacker Pass currently contains a CIM compliant Mineral Reserve of 3 1Mt LCE the largest lithium reserve in the United States with an anticipated mine life of 46 years based on reserves Thacker Pass is at an advanced stage of development with a highly attractive Pre Feasibility Study PFS announced on 21 June 2018 and a Definitive Feasibility Study due for completion in 2021 LAC has announced that key permits are in place with commencement of construction targeted for late 2021 or early 2022 and Trident expects Phase 1 production to start ramping up in 2024 The GRR is subject to a partial operator buy back which Trident expects will be exercised by LAC for proceeds to Trident of US 13 2 million during the first year of operation the Buyback Based on the PFS parameters published by LAC including an LCE price of 12 000 tonne Phase 1 steady state royalty revenue attributable to Trident is anticipated to be approximately US 3 8 million per annum increasing to US 7 6 million per annum at Phase 2 steady state assuming the Buy Back occurs before operations commence As anticipated the third party claimant has named Trident as a party to the existing litigation between Orion Resource Partners regarding the GRR The seller of the royalty has provided Trident with an indemnity subject to customary limitations and exclusions in respect of such proceedings Lake Rebecca Gold Project Apollo Consolidated Ltd Apollo the project operator has committed a material budget increase to advance the Lake Rebecca Gold Project 7 Lake Rebecca de risking the route to a future development decision Apollo has entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell its royalty interest over the Seguela Gold Project in Cote D Ivoire for A 20M cash It stated that the sale will add to existing cash reserves placing Apollo in a very strong position to take Rebecca forward Apollo announced the strategic acquisition of additional land tenure around Lake Rebecca to allow for full operational and planning flexibility as the company moves towards commercial studies 8 Apollo recently issued a JORC 2012 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate MRE update providing a 50 increase in Indicated Mineral Resources to 815 000 ounces to a combined total indicated and inferred optimised

cash and receivables on hand Apollo remains well funded to aggressively advance Lake Rebecca 9 Additional geotechnical drilling on the eastern side of the Lake Rebecca deposit will assist in the outline of an optimised open pit shell for the proposed mine drilling has intersected wide zones of high grade gold mineralisation in two diamond drill holes located in the footwall of the Jennifer Structure 10 Apollo has stated the results from the two holes open potential for previously unknown structures to the east of the current resource with intersections up to 16m 4 12g t Au and 7 4m 4 70g t Au respectively Geotechnical drilling elsewhere on the project also intersected significant gold mineralisation Spring Hill Gold Project Trident notes the receipt of environmental approval for the Spring Hill Gold Project Spring Hill under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act EPBC The approval represents the achievement of a key milestone in the development of Spring Hill clearing the way for next steps toward development Pukaqaqa Copper Project Nexa Resources SA the project operator noted in its 2020 annual filing that the first part of pre feasibility metallurgical results for the Pukaqaqa Copper Project were concluded in December 2020 demonstrating better results than previous campaigns including improved recoveries and grades During 2021 variability tests to confirm results will be held The project budget has been increased by 60 from 2020 to US 2 4 million in 2021 to allow for further metallurgical testing and environmental closure works in the drilling area 11 Warrawoona Gold Project Calidus Resources Ltd Calidus the project operator is completing an integration study on its Blue Spec gold deposit to assess the economics of mining Blue Spec and trucking ore to the nearby Warrawoona plant potentially increasing the robustness of Warrawoona by increasing operating margins 12 In addition Caldius noted in its corporate presentation that Warrawoona will commence main construction this quarter as well as confirming that construction is fully funded and on schedule to pour first gold as planned in the first half of 2022 Mosquito Creek Gold Project Calidus has entered into a Farm In Agreement with Nimble Resources 13 the project operator which gives Calidus the right to earn up to 90 of the Mosquito Creek tenement E46 1035 located about 75km from its Warrawoona gold project and in the vicinity of the Blue Spec mining proposition E46 1035 is located along strike of two geochemical trends identified on tenements immediately to the west Calidus states that many soil and rock chip anomalies on the tenement have not been previously followed up with drilling and fieldwork will start in earnest this calendar year Koolyanobbing Iron Ore Project In its Q3 FY2021 quarterly results 14 Mineral Resources Limited stated that 2 5 million tonnes of iron ore were shipped from the Yilgarn Hub for the quarter Trident holds a 1 5 free on board royalty over the M77 1259 tenement which covers a substantial part of the Deception pit which forms part of the broader Koolyanobbing iron ore operation in Western Australia Mimbula Copper Project Production continues to ramp up at the Mimbula Copper Project and with the copper price recently touching near 10 year highs supported by solid fundamentals the project is well positioned to capitalise on continued positive market sentiment Strong balance sheet to support future acquisitions Unaudited cash balance of US 7 4 million as of 31 March 2021 not inclusive of Q1 royalty revenue which was received post quarter end This substantial cash balance coupled with ongoing projected revenues from two cash generative royalties and an ability to offer vendors publicly tradeable equity in Trident supports capacity for future acquisitions In addition Trident entered into a term sheet with Tribeca Global Resources Credit Pty Ltd during Q1 in respect of a proposed debt facility up to an amount of US 10 million The Facility is subject to the finalisation of definitive documents and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent Indicative of the strength of the pipeline Trident currently has 11 active NDAs under which it is reviewing a range of opportunities across commodities including mineral sands lead nickel copper gold zinc cobalt potash and iron ore and Trident continues to prioritise production or near production assets in order to materially build Trident s near term revenue profile Adam Davidson Chief Executive Officer of Trident commented The first quarter of 2021 was perhaps the most significant for Trident since its admission to trading on AIM less than a year ago with the 28 million acquisition of 60 of the Thacker Pass lithium royalty coupled with a substantial equity raise The fundraising was conducted at no discount to the prevailing share price was significantly oversubscribed and has resulted in a number of new institutional holders establishing a position in the Company In addition to funding our Thacker Pass transaction we have a very healthy balance sheet to support the continued growth and diversification of our royalty portfolio both through acquisition as well as positive asset level progress This bodes exceptionally well for Trident particularly against a global macro backdrop that is increasingly supportive of growing demand for critical commodities Within the last quarter we ve seen material positive updates at Lake Rebecca Spring Hill and the Western Australian Gold Royalty package tenements Revenue continues to remain volatile across Trident s two paying royalties a factor which underpins the opportunity available to Trident by which it can acquire single asset royalties at attractive valuations from natural sellers to ultimately construct a diversified portfolio of royalties with a more predictable payment profile Trident remains focused on executing value accretive transactions across the commodity and development space with a particular focus on enhancing near term revenue References 1 Inclusive of GST 2 Source Trident Royalties announcement dated 29
